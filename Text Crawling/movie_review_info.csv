22761455,1 June 2019,"This movie, a brilliant &amp; touching send off to one of the best series ever aired, is like a study on how to write a finale. Every character has a prime moment, the story flows beautifully and it's full of comedy, pathos &amp; action. It makes me wonder how HBO let some shows go on well past their due date and ended this prematurely. Congratulations to all involved for giving the fans the best send off anyone could expect and more.",4943998,Deadwood
4821031,1 June 2019,"Just wanted to say thanks to HBO, I doubt this was overly profitable but you made a lot of fans happy instead. Great ending to a beloved series.",4943998,Deadwood
34728869,1 June 2019,"Finally, we returned to Deadwood! My family has been waiting for this for SOO Long...we felt like we were attending a family reunion after being away for 10 years...this is the most perfect ending to a perfect series...every once in a while in the movie industry, all actors, actresses, plot, scenery, director &amp; writer come together to make an unforgettable, magical work of art....this is DEADWOOD. The characters have aged but the magnificent prose that each espoused years ago is still as familiar as old slippers....The end was very much like attending the funeral of a beloved relative....too bad there will never be another masterpiece like this show!",4943998,Deadwood
15588823,2 June 2019,"Fantastic to have one last chance to visit these wonderfully rendered characters, listen to the language and lines, and get a feel for the time period again.
An amazing job to get them all back together again and carry on like nothing had passed, except time, and it is not lost on us what a privilege and major feat it was to make that happen, although it shouldn't have been so in the first place, thank you to all involved who pushed this through, diverting budget from another hollow reality show with no meaning, into something of artistic merit, which this most certainly is.To the actual movie/episode; the story was almost secondary to giving the characters some forward movement, and closure, to see how they had carried on with their lives, learned to live with each other etc etc, and the plot did feel kind of secondary to that, ie baddie did something bad, and is found out, case closed etc.Seeing Swearingen age and Succumb to life was a core feature of this episode, but there was so much to fit into such a small space, but so thankful they did. It should be more, why isn't it?",4943998,Deadwood
50301989,1 June 2019,"Blown away, this is my favorite tv series of all time and the best hbo has ever been along with The Wire. I was crying, laughing, shaking, swearing, and feeling so many other emotions throughout the movie that I am exhausted. This was the perfect send of, and every series who is looking to satisfy there fans should follow suit. True to the characters and true to the essence of Deadwood. Thank you for this show as there will never be anything else like it.",4943998,Deadwood
65886849,1 June 2019,"Great to see one of the best series on hbo or all of tv for that matter getting a proper sendoff. But, I can't help but to want to see what happens now. Hopefully I am not alone and we can get a second movie or mini series.",4943998,Deadwood
78126976,1 June 2019,"Mmm...maybe these guys should have written and directed the Game of Thrones attempt...
It's been what..13...years..and it feels like the story never left you. You get sucked right back into this world that you never wanted to leave in the first place.. Unbelievable writing, directing, acting, cinematography....all of it and more...excellent. Maybe a little on the sentimental side, it still had enough of the dark to be 'Deadwood'. It was a well spent couple of hours and I highly recommend it to any fan of the series.",4943998,Deadwood
97841383,5 June 2019,"Although I did enjoy the movie, I did so mainly because I loved the series and was happy to revisit with the characters after so many years. But, I have to say that I was disappointed. As for many Deadwood viewers, I loved the Swearengen character. McShane really stole the series. That's why I was disappointed in a movie where he's reduced to a character completely lacking the personality shown throughout the series.And while I have no complaint with the character, or actress, the amount of time spent on Calamity Jane was completely out of proportion relative to her role during the series.",4943998,Deadwood
25172928,1 June 2019,"I have watched Deadwood many times over and waited in anticipation for this movie. I truly was not disappointed. It was unfortunate that a few characters were missing (due to death and other committments) however it was perfect. It did not feel like years had passed since the final series episode ended.
I cried and I laughed but most of all I wanted it to never end.",4943998,Deadwood
45522156,1 June 2019,"Just finished watching, it was a joy to see these actors again in these roles. I hope it was as much a labor of love for them in measure to the joy it gave us to view the reunion of the characters they portrayed. I'm sure we'll be watching it many times over! Great writing! great acting !",4943998,Deadwood
70958398,1 June 2019,"Based on my opinion of the excellent series I wanted to rate this so much higher.The performances are great, the production values high, dialogue and humour good and delivered well.Unfortunately the plot, or what passes for a plot feels so contrived. Too much packed into 2 hours ruins the pace and impacts on the delivery. No subtlety, no flavour. It's not the Deadwood I remembered so fondly.At the end I felt like I'd watched a Christmas Special of an average drama.",4943998,Deadwood
19009969,4 June 2019,"One of the greatest series of all time gets a tired finishing film! I absolutely loved the program but this just felt forced! We should of got a final season, not an 1h50m of scattered stories which just seemed uninteresting in my opinion...It was fun seeing the characters back together thoughWhen I go back to watching the first three seasons again I won't be adding the film to the rewatch. Pretty disappointing.",4943998,Deadwood
87042890,10 June 2019,"I loved the series but this movie has little of the spontaneous magic that propelled the show. Like the Coens with ""Buster Scruggs,"" director Milch seems to be in love with his script and its interpretation of the vernacular of the times, not paying sufficient attention to direction and emotion. It's all very calculated and pat; the jokes no longer sting, the feelings expressed no longer resonate. It's just a bunch of talk. It all seems like the first day of read through where the actors are trying to find their characters and relate to other characters. Even McShane's Swearengen swearing seems flat this go round. At least we have Trixie!",4943998,Deadwood
71482131,1 June 2019,"As a huge Deadwood fan, I marked my calendar for the Deadwood movie in order to see how everything wrapped up. Unfortunately, it took almost an hour for anything substantive to happen story-wise. Also, the guiding plot line seemed weak. There were a couple of moments of true Deadwood excitement, but these moments were ruined by Al's newfound blandness and weakness. Deadwood's strong point had always been dynamic characters and interesting plots. Neither existed here. I felt let down and like after all these years in hiatus, I deserved more.",4943998,Deadwood
71971058,2 June 2019,"Nice to see the old gang, but OMG, what hath Milch wrought? The characters have all the same dialogue now, the words of Shakespeare and the syntax of Yoda.",4943998,Deadwood
25217752,1 June 2019,Movie was absolutely perfect in its execution. It seemed like time passed in the blink of an eye. Thank you HBO and writers and directors and actors and cinematographers for providing me two hours of grade A entertainment. It was also a great tear jerker at the end.,4943998,Deadwood
33878176,1 June 2019,"Love the series and like the way the movie ties up the story. The characters are great and their personalities have not been lost.
My only complaint is that the dialog seemed forced and at times like the actors were reading the script for the first time.",4943998,Deadwood
103769742,1 June 2019,"I just finished my first watchthrough of the series Deadwood this morning. Right before the film came out. I am astounded that I missed something this incredible. You come for the western setting and you stay for the expertly crafted characters and the slow burn compelling story. This film is the absolute perfect send off of the characters, though only being around for 36 episodes, make you feel like you've known them all your life. A master class of conclusions.",4943998,Deadwood
103021127,2 June 2019,"This sucked. The flowery dialogue gave me a headache. Too much, trying too hard. Same story, same players, but a very unclear storyline. Just, meh.",4943998,Deadwood
59283986,8 June 2019,"Kudos to the producers for bringing back almost every character and the actors who portrayed them from the series which ended 13 years ago.
It was good to see and probably speaks to the experience the actors had filming the series.
This film, while welcome, felt thin. Some characters hardly received any screen time and fewer lines. Some of the speech was hard to appreciate during the first half of the movie (there is a whole scene early in the movie between Utter and Bullock that was unintelligible to me!) It improved greatly during the second half.
I don't know if this is billed as a finale but not resolving several major plot lines leaves the possibility of another film down the road.
Being ""The Movie"" I think the moviegoer would like to see the plots resolved and due to the fact that they weren't makes this a entertaining but ultimately dissatisfying experience.",4943998,Deadwood
67432377,12 June 2019,"Daniel Weiss and David Benioff ... Take Note: Ever hear the adage that if you don't have anything good (constructive) to say, you should remain silent? Well, better to have remained silent than to attempt to wrap up something without having a clue how to do it. ... For the proper way to do it, see Deadwood, The movie.THIS is the way to properly end something that was once considered game-changing and essential in its field.Beautiful, funny, moving.""The world ends when you're dead ... Until then, you got more punishment in store. Stand it like a man-and give some back."" -Al Swearengen",4943998,Deadwood
69062529,1 June 2019,"It is like a one-off gig by a much loved band. All the members are there (if they aren't dead, or on other projects), singing all the songs. Nothing new here.I kept on expecting it to actually get moving, then it finished. It is basically a 90 min version of the TV show. To call it a ""movie"" is a bit disingenuous, an old style TV movie if anything. This one didn't tie up any loose threads, and left plenty hanging, maybe for a new season.Was great to see Ian Mcshane again if nothing else.",4943998,Deadwood
64325414,2 June 2019,"I am an avid fan of the first 3 seasons, bought them all at full price when they can out. All I can say is the story was very weak, no plot, bad acting, and the ending looked like a Hallmark Christmas movie ending..... Very disappointed...",4943998,Deadwood
41031967,5 June 2019,This had moments - and it was great to see the cast back. But it was not a very good Western movie. Dialogue was corny. Felt like Hallmark movie. :(,4943998,Deadwood
2975218,18 June 2019,"Felt more more like a long sequence of outtakes from 15 years ago.Absolutely nothing new here. Story didn't go anywhere. Drama for the sake of drama.As others have already pointed out, Al has been completed neutered. He started going soft towards the end of the series but this was really something else.All in all this was a complete waste and I'm going to pretend it never happened. It actually taints the memory of the show I adored.",4943998,Deadwood
2679951,1 June 2019,"This was not a cheap effort to grab viewers based on nostalgia, but rather a closing chapter worthy of the captivating series that aired for three short seasons. Expertly written and acted, it hit all the right notes and moved me. Without going into details that could spoil I'll just say that yes, we could definitely use a sequel to this but if there is none that would be fine too. Love love loved it",4943998,Deadwood
18447846,4 June 2019,"I'm a huge enthusiast of the original Deadwood show. I watched it when it originally aired, and have watched it many times since then. I consider it to be one of the greatest shows ever made. As you might imagine, I was very excited about this movie and a return to Deadwood. However, I watched the movie yesterday and can tell you I'm disappointed with what I saw.Here is the main issues I had with this movie: (This review will contain spoilers from now on)The dialogue is noticeably different. I did read that the original writer couldn't work on this show and my goodness does it show. The words aren't as memorable, poetic, witty, etc. It's all very bland when compared to the original series and there's none of those classic exchanges we remember so well.Doc Cochran had TB at the end of Season 3 and this was never addressed in the Movie. Also, E.B. Farnum's hotel might have a new balcony but how is it he can now move around the outside of the hotel building in secret passageways looking through peepholes? E.B. was always very intrusive when it came to the business of others and had such passages existed prior we would've been made aware of that during the original three seasons of the show. Also, Calamity Jane shoots a man dead in the movie which is very uncharacteristic as she always had a big mouth but you could ""knock her over with a feather"".Many of the characters have been brought back but they're not performing their original roles. Instead, they've been shoehorned in to others in order to further what little plot their is. Harry Manning, the harmless would be firefighter, is now a treacherous underling of George Hurst. Aunt Lou isn't a cook at the hotel anymore instead she's a midwife which is convenient since there's a baby needing delivered. Even Con Stapleton has somehow become a minister which is also handy as there's a body to be buried and a wedding to oversee. Yes, the show has many of the same actors but they weren't needed and have been shoehorned in to various roles for the sake of getting on screen.There is no new storylines here. The movie spends a good while reintroducing all the characters when they didn't have time for that. Once the characters have been introduced and they've tried to reignite the hostility between the camp and Hurst the movie is quickly coming to a close.Hurst is a brutal man who forces others to bend to his will. He wanted Trixie dead and bribed a couple of nearby Sheriffs to execute a warrant on it. He wanted a piece of land and the camp denied that to him. The Sheriff also embarrasses Hurst by yet again dragging him by the ear in to cells. Hurst is an extremely powerful person and you would imagine the Pinkertons would be called in and murdering to start taking place after this movie ends. There's no real resolution as far as Hurst goes we're exactly where we left off.Following on from my last point about Hurts. In season 3 Hurst kills the husband of Alma Garret to force her to sell her land to him. Alma complies because she has to, Hurst will stop at nothing to get what he wants. In the movie Alma buys a piece of land Hurst wants to install telephone polls thus putting herself in the exact same situation as she was back in season 3. That makes very little sense. Similarly, the killing of Ellseworth (Alma's husband) results in conflict with the entire camp and the Sheriff in a fit of temper locks up Hurst dragging him by the ear to jail. In the movie Hurst kills another man because he wants land, is lead to the jail house by the ear, but we're to believe Hurst will be issued justice this time? The same Hurst who can rig entire elections and have his man appointed Sherriff? The same Hurst who, with one call, can have the Pinkertons fall upon on Deadwood like locusts? The same Hurst who can bride just about anyone and swing juries whichever way he sees fit? A kicking in the thoroughfair wouldn't humble Hurst or make him back down he's a savage sociopath.Al Swearengen is the strongest character on the show. We want to see him cutting throats and working on his ""deployments and flanking manoeuvres"". Sadly, Al is portrayed as a shell of his former self in this movie and we're not treated to the formidable, intelligent, witty, cut throat we all know and loved. In the end it seems like they killed him off although we get a Soprano style fade to black rather than something conclusive so I guess we'll never know.Al, who is apparently dying, leaves his saloon to Trixie. Now, Al and Dan were cutting throats in the woods a long time before they even entered the Deadwood camp. They built the Gem Saloon together ""blow for blow"". Dan is Al's right hand man is nothing but a ""creature on hind legs"" without him. Yet, this new Al decides to hand the Gem over to Trixie (who has long since moved on and has an independently wealthy husband) and tells her she can turn his bar in to a dancehall. Dan's years of loyalty (something that these two would never break) apparently counts for nothing.Lastly, the violence and swearing the TV show was renowned for is noticeably absent here. I don't know if it had to be dulled down for a straight to TV movie, or if it was due to having different writers, but it's certainly not the same. I didn't like the movie and honestly feel it would need a complete season 4 to do this program justice. I know many will say 'something is better than nothing' but in this case I disagree. If a 4th season was never on the table they should've just left it.",4943998,Deadwood
71250509,3 June 2019,"Before there were a few fancy talkers, but now everyone in the entire movie is suddenly Shakespeare. Nothing happens. There is no closure. Pretty much nothing changes and I have no idea why this movie was made.",4943998,Deadwood
406567,1 June 2019,"For a show known for it's complexity and raw portray of the wild west combined with clever writing and amazing set pieces, this return is nothing but a small gift to the fans of the original show, but here lies also some of this movies biggest problems.This movie has indeed the same type of witty dialogue that we saw from the original show, but the story makes no sense what so ever. There are too many coincidences that happens in a too short period of time, that makes it all unbelievable and that takes me out of the story. This is not clever writing, this is the writers struggling to find a plot that fits within the time frame of a movie, but still delivering the exact same depth the show originally had.This film makes little to no sense to anyone who isn't a fan of the original series, because there aren't any character building here, these are characters we all learned to love and hate over the course of many years, only now to have all their stories concluded. But here is a problem in all this, if this movie is made solely for the fans, which it is, the flashback clips feels totally out of place. A show that was carried by clever and intelligent dialogue which at points required a university masters degree to interpret, it feels odd to be reminded of what once was, like we didn't even remember what happened all those years ago. The fans knows, and if they don't, well then they weren't paying attention.This movie was in production hell for years and once they found the time and place to finally produce it, the end product is a testament they were in a rush to get it done before it ended back there. And the way the story is told is the main problem, if the story isn't air tight, it starts to leak out though some of the performances, how is an actor suppose to deliver, when their lines don't add up? In the end, this story serves only one purpose, to give fans closure. The fans wanted more seasons, HBO could not deliver, so here we have a movie instead. Thing is, now i wished i never saw this movie, i would rather choose for myself what happened to all these character. But i had to see it, i was hoping for the best, HBO mostly delivers, but as we also saw with Season 8 of Game of Thrones, they can also fail.The movie comes off as a weird shadow of it former self, nothing new is brought to the table. This is a rerun of the deadwood series compressed down to less than two hours, only made to be a tribute to the fans, to give the fans a ""proper"" ending, and weirdly at the same time treat the fans as thus they can't remember what happened in the first place. This is the very definition of bad writing, it does not remove this fact even if you smear clever dialogue all over it to try and hide it. This entire movie, to put it simply, is pretty dumb compared to the series.I just wished there would be something original here, something entirely new. But it just feels like time has stood still for 10 years, and here we are back with the exact same issues and the exact same story we have already been told. Just with some added things here and there as filler.I'm sorry but that ain't good enough. For a show that was this great, we should expect more. It might sound like I'm trashing this movie now, i ain't. I'm disappointed, though we have a bad story on our hands we still have the same old characters, and it's always fun to see Al and George go at it, and the atmosphere is basically exactly as we all remember. So the movie has watch value for sure, but only for those that saw the original show.5/10 - Mediocre",4943998,Deadwood
54544656,1 June 2019,"What a fabulous compliment to the genius of David Milch that 13 years after the last episode of Deadwood that all of the actors, except Powers Booth and Richardson, that helped make this series so loved by us faithful fans agreed to come back and give the series a proper conclusion. Thank you Mr Milch and thank you HBO.",4943998,Deadwood
6111776,10 June 2019,"Judging by reviews before me I will be in minority in my review. found it to be a very average tv production. Writing was not up to original series by long shot. Pacing was overly slow.. it's worth watching, but don't expect the original,",4943998,Deadwood
20758467,22 June 2019,This 10 years later film was incredibly dull and consisted mostly of the cast reflecting on a few key events of the original series. Hardly anything interesting or memorable happens in this follow up feature. It's basically a rehashing of an old feud and that's it. The great original cast is wasted here with nothing much new to say or do. What a drag.,4943998,Deadwood
60689236,3 June 2019,"So, after all the wait, the 'Deadwood' movie that's just come out turns out to be predominantly a waste of time and upon reflection I think I would have preferred it to never have been made at all.Very, very little happens, the characters are all reintroduced for no good reason, don't say or do anything of any import and end up no further along than when we last saw them ten years earlier. Molly Parker's character, in particular, drifts through the story like a pointless ghost, but pretty much every character apart from Charlie Utter could have been removed and it would not have changed the story one jot.There are no real new storylines to speak of and the dialogue all round is abysmal, with everyone talking like Yoda doing Shakespearean improv while coping with Tourette's. Not even Al Swearengen gets to speak one memorable line in the whole god-damn thing.The Hearst story remains just as pointlessly unresolved as it was before, and the whole thing just gradually grinds down to an unremarkable halt, tarnishing the memory of all that went before.It's not quite the Game Of Thrones finale all over again, but it's not far off. Further proof one should never trust the opinions of professional critics in 2019.",4943998,Deadwood
103437466,1 June 2019,"Not much to add to what other reviewers have said,just a wonderful ending to a great series.I could have done without the character of Caroline though nothing against Jade Pettyjohn she's a good young actress,but the character added nothing to the storyline.",4943998,Deadwood

7048882,2 June 2019,"Decent imitation of the real thing, but it's only skin deep .The grit and overall naughtiness is gone, this is just the original cast doing a Deadwood themed stage play at a nursing home .One extra star for the actors, but they couldn't save this shameless money grab from being an utter failure .",4943998,Deadwood
29069573,6 June 2019,"Even though it was nice reacquainting with the cast of one of my all time favourite shows, i really dont see why they would bother making this film. I was hoping to get some conclusion to the series but it ended as abroubtly as the series did. Good filming and nostalgia raises my grade to a 5.",4943998,Deadwood
103959991,4 June 2019,"Meh. It was fun to see everyone (almost) again, but that's it. A very boring reminiscence and rehash - an insult to the series.",4943998,Deadwood
64841446,5 June 2019,"I really wonder sometimes about the reason for the high ratings of some movies!!! why??? in our case what is really the distinctive things in Deadwood the movie to have such high ratings? the answer is not so difficult; nothing...except the fancy dialogues, which is more closer to the theatrical dialogue. except that; we spent less than two hours with ambiguous depressing atmospheres, and so many recalls of past incidents shortened and incomprehensible, odd characters without understandable roots or causes. I can't only say...Why!!!",4943998,Deadwood
33856397,2 June 2019,"I've seen all three seasons of the show four times and I think it was a real burn to David Milch that HBO decided not to renew for a fourth season. Hence for reasons listed in the trivia, the movie came about.
I liked the fact that most of the main characters came back. They're why the show was so good. But a movie format simply didn't do justice to the characters. Instead the focus was put on a predictable incomplete plot line that could have been fleshed out if the show had continued. Five years later would have worked just as well as a time line with ALL the characters being available (Welliver and Booth, specifically.)",4943998,Deadwood
68878008,1 June 2019,"I am a HUUUUUGE Deadwood fan! I've watched the series a dozen times at least. I massively enjoyed this film but I do have a couple of very minor issues. It took about 30 minutes in before it finally hit it's stride. I get it. We need to reacquaint ourselves with the characters after so long and to redevelop them. It just felt a tad forced and frankly, a little weird. Finally, it still seems like there should be more. Maybe, just maybe this could be a starting point for perhaps one more season or fellow Deadwood fans, do you believe this is good enough? I personally would dig maybe another 10 episodes to go through more of what truly happened in Deadwood all the way to the fire that devistated the town! Anyways.......",4943998,Deadwood
3689994,2 June 2019,"I enjoyed season 1 of Deadwood -especially with the chance to see Brad Dourif - but when season two rolled around with its cod Iambic pentameter, I coudn't watch it anymore. And, within ten mins of watching ""the Movie"", I, once again, had had to quit.For me, using such a stilted theatrical convention throws me right out of the story. I don't understand what the writer(s) think it is bringing to the table.Just why? ....and Hey, if we are going for a forced formal style, let's go with, say, Rhyming CoupletsDOCTOR: I have seen what ails you, and the results make me shiver.

So sad.",4943998,Deadwood
32583938,2 June 2019,"To be blunt, I expected this movie to be better. Instead it was a long rehash of what was and a small slice of something new, with some social justice thrown in that seems very out of place in what they initially spent seasons as portraying a very non-politically correct place in the world.Parts of it are painful to watch as each original actor remembers something from a previous season and we are suffered to watch the old footage portraying the memory.The original series was great because it didn't try to be preachy, weepy and melancholic.This movie based on the series is not very good because that is all strives for, a preachy, weepy and melancholic view of what the original series spent seasons not being.P.S. The ending is weak and unfulfilling.",4943998,Deadwood

4703614,25 April 2020,"I anger quit this show during season 3 when they announced it was cancelled in favor of John From Cincinnati. But with time on my hands I rewatched and completed the series. Honestly, the Season 3 finale was like spit on my face that I could not wipe off. Not in what happened necessarily, but that that was it. A huge thank you to the late Mr. Milch and the cast and crew for this movie. Reading some of the reviews and what I had heard from friends, I feel like people aren't looking at it within the confines of what it is, a 109 minute, 14 year after the fact love letter to the fans who never got closure. It's the difference between writing a novel like tv show and a short story like movie. A return of our favorite actors/characters using language only Milch can provide. The story was well written especially considering the time given. The actors were fantastic and it seemed like it was last year, not 14 years ago when last they played these roles. I also think they did a great job in selecting the character moments they did considering they had less than 2 hours. Feel like some just can't appreciate a show or movie anymore unless it's dark, disturbing and/or comes with a bummer or mysterious ending to debate what happened. A very satisfying ending to a show I loved that stayed true to the story and characters. My only real criticism is that they couldn't find a 3rd character for Garret Dillahunt to play. Who of course dies.",4943998,Deadwood
1893630,4 August 2019,"Directed by Daniel Minahan. Starring Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Gerald McRaney, Paula Malcolmson, John Hawkes, Molly Parker, Robin Weigert, Kim Dickens, William Sanderson, Dayton Callie, Brad Dourif, Sean Bridgers, W. Earl Brown, Jade Pettyjohn, Leon Rippy, Franklin Ajaye, Jeffrey Jones. (TV-MA)Epilogue of sorts to the acclaimed HBO series about 19th-century residents of Deadwood picks up about a decade after the show's abrupt end (cancellation). Narrative centers on the return of corrupt George Hearst (McRaney), now a senator, to attend the commemoration of the South Dakota statehood, but just like the series that preceded it, the film takes the time to weave myriad characters and sub-plots (while tying up a few loose ends along the way). Ten years have passed (though, judging by the occasionally exorbitant makeup, several of the characters look like they've aged twenty) but not a whole lot has changed; Farnum is still mayor, Bullock is still the law of the land, Al is still, well, Al, etc. Since nearly every still-living cast member is back, the movie labors at times to trot them all out (a few get little more than token cameos) but the escalating pace and focus on the Hearst vs. town throughline makes for riveting entertainment. The expanded scope and richer production values are about the only things announcing this as a proper ""movie"" instead of an extended coda episode (note the increase in wide and medium shots over the series' frequent closeups to show it off), but it's a worthy cap to one of the better dramatic television programs of the 00s, featuring an exceptional cast delivering all those scintillating (and profane) passages of dialogue. McShane's final declaration before the credits roll must rank as one of best closing lines for a movie in years.82/100",4943998,Deadwood
64798417,28 February 2020,"I never saw the TV series, but know this was 10 years after the last episode, and the writers did a great job with the flash-backs to bring me up to speed. But not being accustomed to the TV series' Shakespearean dialogue and the constant foul language, I felt it was annoying and unrealistic. Had this been a stand-alone Western, it would've flopped. But considering the TV shows acceptance, I can understand the hype and compliance. As a movie, the directing was excellent, the story on its own merit decent, and the cinematography and timely sets and costumes outstanding. The casting was good, but I feel without Ian McShane, I wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much. He made this film come to life. It's a generous 8/10 from me",4943998,Deadwood

Now all this time passes and Hollywood just couldn't leave dead dogs buried. They had to dig it up out of the grave and for whatever reason that eludes me, finish it up I guess years later when everyone in the original story would probably have been long dead already. Jeez. When I saw that they made this movie, I just knew they were going to screw it up. And they did. This was too big a bill to fill from the beginning and they should have left it alone. They managed to dig up the original actors. They were all older and the acting for the most part was forced, and the atmosphere was not recreated. It just didn't feel right (if you had watched original series). The only one for me that remained the truest and most natural to the old character was Timothy Olypfant. Everyone else didn't cut the mustard for me. I blame this on the script writer and director. They didn't bring out what these characters had to offer in this remake.

28643054,15 June 2019,"Deadwood was a series that had it all with sex, violence, and the most gratuitous use of bad language ever seen on small screen. The dialogue was difficult to understand and when they liberally tossed out the F bombs and the C words (both of them) you would blush at how abundantly they were used. Despite being a western this series did have a Shakespearian quality to it. Underneath all that profanity there was a great story to be told with intrigue and trickery, great villains and heroes, honourable and dishonourable characters which kept us guessing to how it would all end. The series had class and authenticity about how it must have been like to live in the old west with the bad skin and yellow teeth. It's so authentic and rich that you could just about feel like you were part of the old west. I believe that Deadwood portrayed an authentic west, the characters having the many flaws that humans have. One of the most memorable characters that I particularly liked was Al Swearengen, who struggled throughout the series to find a balance between maintaining his humanity in a land which was wild as it was savage and trying to survive. It was difficult to like Al Swearengen because he was willing to kill if he didn't get his way and at the same time was capable of killing to protect the one he cares about. Deadwood the movie finally gave us closure even though it felt a bit rushed. I for one believe that it deserved a good full season in order to wrap up loose ends.",4943998,Deadwood

Why is it dead boring? First because if one divides the story into 20 parts, then 17 parts are filmed in the bedrooms, 1 in the doorway to the bedroom, 1 in the street, and 1 in the forest. Where is the wild west there? Mr. SpongeBob SquarePants only knows.
Second, everyone would expect a little bit different English language (or slang) than today in the American west during the late of the 1800's, but surely no one expects that language to be ""Shakespearian"" in the heaviest theatrical mode.
Third, conversations take forever and ever and ever.

104122464,8 June 2019,"The Deadwood TV series was/is in a league of its own: storylines, acting and cinematography which ensured each episode was unmissable. Ian McShane's finest acting role by far. Thank you HBO.Unfortunately, a concluding fourth series was never made. A huge mistake by HBO and a bitter disappointment to the fans of Deadwood.Did the TV movie provide closure? Perhaps.

16760123,3 June 2019,"Ok, for a 'themed' western, but not the 'Deadwood' that we remember...Spotty dialogue delivery by some, awkward acting by others, a fabricated political story (oh, so trendy...), a little social correctness, and various other cracks in this otherwise well produced feature allowed just a smidge too much unavoidable ""Hollywood"" into the presentation. They tried hard to find the magic of the original series, and found some of it...but some is only part of what it was originally. I found myself enjoying the film for reasons other than the ones that made me love the original series. But honestly, the dialogue came-off more contrived, story-lines seemed injected with modernism that is out-of-pace, the actors sometimes seemed like they didn't know what to do with their hands, the support cast's dialogue is totally out-of-step with the principal actors'.Not a bad film, but definitely not Deadwood from before.",4943998,Deadwood
103812268,1 June 2019,"I didn't realize how much I wanted to see a followup to this show, thinking it had actually ended up concluding with a poetic lack of closure, but the end of the movie nearly brought me to tears with one of the best executed tales of aging and the passing of time I have ever seenThe movie doesn't pick off from moving nowhere, don't listen to the reviewers here who seem like they'd have been unsatisfied no matter what happened and just regurgitated moment for moment the exact tonality and feel of the old episodes. There's a feeling of grief about the characters, a lack of closure that parallels quite well what many of the fans felt. The characters couldn't move on from what had happened to them, just like we couldn't move on from the show and why so many of us where thrilled when this film was announced. The characters are older, not necessarily wiser, but there's a lack of energy and a different outlook on life in each of their eyes. Seth stepped up, and with Olyphant and Milch working closely together to revise the roll, they were able to make Bullock the star he always deserved to be and a fitting successor to Al Swearengen. And Swearengen himself goes through a metamorphosis, a retrospective at the end of a long life of violence and regret in service to order. A metamorphosis all the more poignant when mirrored by David Milch's own declining health. He wasn't neutered, like Mr. Angst said below. He got old, and as we often do started to think about what he had accomplished and was going to leave behind.Each and every character, from Jane and Jonie finally finding a stable peace, to the marriage of Sol and Trixie that parallels the marriage of South Dakota to the union, and even Alma Elsworth's finally closing old wounds and finding peace in the pride of her daughter, all the characters got the sendoff and the conclusion they deserved.I may have rambled a bit, but I feel as though this movie deserved a bit of defense from the people who seem to have watched it with such a plot in mind that they couldn't accept that time passes, people and characters grow, and that Milch's theme of burgeoning civilization upon which the whole show was based on centers around a philosophy of a long arc of history that bends towards improvement. As another of Ian McShane's characters said ""It's never too late to stop killing people and start helping people. It's never to late to come back."" I liked that Al found that peace in the end, in his own rough and peculiar way.Thank you, David Milch and crew. It's been one hell of a ride.",4943998,Deadwood
7018125,30 July 2019,"I was a huge fan of the original series, and what a disappointment that David Milch abandoned the series in favor of producing John from Cincinnati, which was just absolute garbage.

Sure it was great to see all the original cast, and they've aged well, I'll give them that. The movie on the other hand, felt rushed, contrived, and forced.

But the reality is, apart from the satisfaction of getting a peek at a still-thriving Deadwood village ten years later, this movie offers very little. They tried to cram an entire season's worth of conflict and drama into a two hour whirlwind. And so it almost feels like you're being dragged along on this chaotic ride. A lot of moving parts, without enough time to develop the new storylines. In the end, it was nice to see everyone again. But this movie wasn't really necessary, and did nothing to enhance the franchise. Nothing 'new' happened. No big reveals that help us understand the original story any better. Just two more hours of Deadwood. Lots of F bombs, creatively and poetically inserted, and tons of the needless lofty shakespearian rhetoric.

The first guy had to be in his late twenties, Dan, maybe mid-thirties. Ten years later, they look like retirees. Jewel is even worse, she looked like she was in her twenties in the original show, now she looks like a grandmother, ROFLMAO. The actress is like 62, ok, but Jewel in the movie looks like she is in her mid-eighties, which is nuts. The one character that was old in the last movie looks even younger in this film and that was Hearst. Crazy stuff, TBH.I felt like I wasted two hours by the end of the movie, LOL. Can't recommend.

First of all you lost the feeling you had with the characters during the series, you forgot almost everything about it except the obvious leading characters that marked this show. The characters are still worth watching, amazing how older some became in thirteen years, but you don't get that same atmosphere from the series. The acting is still good, the old English still difficult to understand, but the quality of the series is just not there.

69791874,2 June 2019,"When Deadwood first aired, it was my favorite show immediately, and was amazed at how good a television show could actually be! This was a movie-quality series, better than most movies out at the time. However, something changed in Season 2, and they lost me as a viewer. A couple of years back, I binged the series over a few weeks, and found that the show returned and even surpassed its former glory, and Season 3 was actually best season of the show.The Deadwood Movie, although 13 years later, takes the events of Season 3, and brings back the show's most frightening villain, George Hurst (Gerald McRaney). Season 3 showed a Father/Son relationship developing between Al and Bullock. This relationship continues in the Deadwood Movie, with Hurst as the common enemy of the two.The dialogue, the acting, the sets, and the atmosphere - all are continuations of where Deadwood left off. This is the movie I've been waiting for since I finished watching Season 3!While most of the world has been focused on the Game of Thrones finale these last few weeks, Deadwood quietly, brilliantly, and gracefully provided one of the most amazing finales in recent history.

The characters have flashbacks of their situations 10 years ago in the pioneer town of Deadwood.
Now I want to say I thought the movie was better than the series
I couldn't figure out why this series was so popular?
I started to watch it a few years ago and didn't like the profanity and violence so I stopped after the 1st episode.
Since this Covid has made me stay home more I watched all 3 seasons.
I've heard more profanity lately from neighbors complaining because of the rules with Covid soooo
Why not watch Deadwood?
The 1st season made me want to keep watching...
But the next 2 seasons were a disappointment to me.
Very slow without substance.
To be fair the acting was why I watched this. The actors drew me in and made this series watchable.
I thought with the famous Hearst coming to Deadwood it would get better.
It dragged on and on. I wanted to see what happened at the end of this so I skipped a few episodes and watched the intro at the beginning which told you what happened the last episode.
I thought the people of Deadwood would stand their ground with the deceitful inhumane Hearst.
The only courage in this town was a prostitute who shot Hearst in the arm. Cowardly Hearst-- shot in the arm wanted to avenge his shooting by killing her.
I couldn't believe Swenegen was such a coward to do what Hearst wanted?
That's when it went downhill for me.
And what's with Calamity Jane?
I read she was a sharp shooter and would have a better role?
The character didn't do her justice.
The ending was the letdown of any series I've ever watched.
Why this was one of the more popular series I'll never figure out--even though most of it is written of what supposedly happened in Deadwood, I'm sure a pioneer western town had people that weren't scared and cowards.",4943998,Deadwood

Having this on in the background shot me back to simpler times; enjoying the mud-street poetry and slavish devotion to honouring the TV series' tone and look. Deadwood: The Movie is a hard film to review; seemingly a feature-length finale more than a standalone movie, but it is a fitting end, beautiful, bawdy, sure-footed and honeyed in dialogue. As a movie, nothing much happens and it's glorious. As a coda, it's a warm bath.",4943998,Deadwood
1002035,22 September 2019,"Like almost everyone, I loved Deadwood when it was on, and it is rightly considered along other greats of the same period. While I was sad it was cancelled, I didn't feel that the season finale was a bad place for the series to end. It fitted with the realism of progress and bigger picture, and it was suitably downbeat and violence in what it did. Many disagreed, and the idea of a movie to close it out has been around for ages. Hence we got this movie, although it really doesn't give 'closure' to the series, only adds to the show in the same way that a holiday special does - in that it does everything the regular series does, but reduced somewhat by virtue of what it is.So it is here. We get all the comedy, wry and engaging dialogue, moral conflict, violence, unfairness, and cruelty of the show, but done in a very contained way. This means a that a lot feels forced in and rushed; all of it is appreciated for what it does but its main value is in nostalgia for when it once did it the same but as part of a better whole. This also adds to the feeling of them rushing, as this is a lot to get into even 2 hours. In terms of the characters, they are also all there and are nice to see again in their various forms, but in terms of where/who they are, the movie needs them to be responsive to the previous season - for some this is okay as they linger on things and are deeply changed, but it doesn't ring true that everyone would be in that space beyond them needed to be because for the first time the viewer is back.It works for what it is though - a nostalgia return to a great series, that does the things it used to do in ways that are familiar and solidly entertaining. It doesn't feel like, or serve as, a real extension of the series though, and it didn't really feel necessary anyway. It is a nice-to-have, and I enjoyed it, but its main impact on me was to remind me that I should rewatch the original show.",4943998,Deadwood

26266323,11 July 2019,"Thirteen years after its abrupt cancellation, HBO's finally put the band back together for a proper conclusion to Deadwood, its unfinished Shakespearean western. The result fits like an old pair of boots. Perhaps a bit dustier than before, withered and cracked and worn, but no less familiar.It's pleasant to occupy this world again, to see all the familiar faces rubbing elbows and butting heads, but the limits of a two-hour movie are far more pervasive than those of a twelve-hour season. Particularly so when applied to a show like this one, which has always made good use of television's episodic format by employing lengthy exposition, carefully distributed plot points and a whole mess of exceptionally well-developed secondary characters. I wanted more time with Doc, with Dan, with Wu, but instead the supporting cast only pops in for the occasional cameo, then fades back into the woodwork in the name of a big-players-only featured narrative. And even that feels a hair on the light side, with an armload of unnecessary flashbacks and a rather easy, under-thought resolution. Al gets a big speech or two, Bullock is given the chance to grit his teeth and stare daggers, Hearst acts smug and operates in underhanded ways, and then... we're done, and it's goodbye forever.I understand why it had to be this way, and I'm grateful for the long-awaited chance at closure, but I'm also disappointed it couldn't have been three or four times longer. In a way, I'm even hungrier for a fourth season than I was before.",4943998,Deadwood

I dont post reviews often but felt I would as a vote in the hope of bringing back quality shows like this, and Rome was also cut short sadly. I'd sooner a fourth or fifth season of this kind of quality over recent shows to come from hbo.
May not produce as much money, but for craftsmanship the creators of shows like this can be proud to have their names in the credits.",4943998,Deadwood

94715842,31 May 2020,"I am coming at Deadwood The Movie from a different perspective: Someone who never saw the series. Why? I am more of a Western movie fan then a series fan. Deadwood is a good western but not a great western: That is reserved for The Big Country, Shane and films like that. The main reason you watch is Ian McShane ( Al). It is strange seeing anyone who is not from the US or Canada ( Lorne Greene and Glenn Ford were from there) in a western, the only exception besides the British McShane to stand out was Australian Errol Flynn. The other excellent character was Senator George Hearst ( Gerald McRaney), he was evil and arrogant and he made you despise that character. The biggest problem were the women: Calamity Jane ( Robin Weigert) as a lesbian, was historically inaccurate. and Anna Gunn as Martha the wife of Wyatt Earp type Marshall Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant, and the rest of the ladies were basically flat. It was all McShane, McRaney and some of Olyphant that made it a good film. 8/10 stars.",4943998,Deadwood

4445176,2 June 2019,"Like many of us, I was disappointed in the way the series ""ended"" without a real end. After years of rumors of a possible theatrically released movie or movies, HBO finally reassembled the stellar cast of one of my favorite shows ever to air.
Without spoilers, I will say that David Milch did the series justice with his superb writing ability and talent. It was incredible to see some of the finest characters ever written brought back to the screen. The acting powerhouse that is Ian McShane anchors the cast once again and proves that his range and talent is second to none in his generation. Timothy Olyphant, John Hawkes, Robin Weigert and the rest of the original cast all bring their ""A"" Game, as well. If you were a fan of the original series as I was, do not miss this movie. I tip my hat and raise a whiskey to David Milch, Ian McShane and the rest of the cast and crew for their fine work. Thank you for a superb finale.",4943998,Deadwood
58189431,9 June 2019,"The bad writing in the final episode of the series continued in movie finale. The series had been a fresh and dirty interpretation of the old west. But it was reduced to an immorality tale of a defenseless and innocent prostitute being murdered and the self chosen ones in the town going along with it. There is no justice and no one in the end pays for their vile sins. Redemption comes via having babies and two main characters getting married. Perhaps this is how the west was. But if so, I would have sooner watched two hours of swearenger's testicles. Because that basically is what this series in the end turned out to be.",4943998,Deadwood
10067675,4 June 2019,"As another reviewer said, we miss the original writer. This one is in Old English and you have to really focus to understand what they are saying. I'm not sure if the writers didn't have a clue about history or wanted to make a name for themselves but people didn't talk like that in the old west. Also, as mentioned by several others, Calamity Jane had a thing for Wild Bill and later married a man. Why they have her chasing a woman here is confusing. The story is good but the whole thing feels rushed. We needed 10 episodes instead of 90 minutes. I guess everyone involved has other projects and couldn't commit a year to it. Overall a good effort, good to see the characters again but unfulfilling.",4943998,Deadwood

Deadwood remained consistent and respectful to character development and this movie remained true to these characters.
Each character aged appropriately and moved along a logical path 10 years down the road.
So many times a series is ripped from our grasp with no closure. Or at times the closure is rushed and makes no sense. Plot points are created and a resolution plucked out of this air.
Thank you Deadwood Showrunners for remaining true to Al Swearingen and the rest of the Camp.",4943998,Deadwood
95989967,22 August 2019,"I thought this would be a really good movie but I was disappointed. The characters are there and they are portrayed by the same people but it does not seem like the same Deadwood. Maybe this is the result of aging 10 years. I don't know. I kept watching the movie hoping for more development of the plot. But then, the movie ended. I felt that more had to have happened to these people. Why not tell us what it was? Maybe the time slot for the movie was too restrictive. If that was the case, maybe it should have been a multi-part mini-series. Time would be better spent watching or re-watching the original seasons. I am not able to give this movie more stars.",4943998,Deadwood

7998841,8 June 2019,"First off, to really appreciate this movie you needed to have seen the TV series. People have complained of a lack of plot, but it was really a continuance of what happened in the last season. Even the series was a slow mover with the emphasis being on the characters more than the plot and so no way was an intricate plot going to appear in an under 2 hour movie.I wasn't sure before hand that I was going to enjoy this, but I was pleasantly surprised, especially as the main characters picked up from where they had left off. To me, this was just like watching an extended episode.It gave me some closure because the last season ended with you wanting to know what was going to happen next. There are always going to be people who feel underwhelmed by a concluding movie like this, but I for one, thought a good job was done all round.",4943998,Deadwood
16207494,1 June 2019,It was really great seeing most of the cast back for the final part of the Deadwood story. Even though it depicts historical figures.

Still good to see some character arc wrap up, but it didn't have to keep on as much as it did. Also feel like the plot needed more of a slow burn amd the movie expanded to 2.5-3 hours. Other than that the dialogue, action, and atmosphere were all on par with everything that came before it.Ending leaves me feeling HBO wants to see how this performs. We may get more films?

55062459,1 June 2019,"No way it ends like this. I believe a long time ago they planned three movies to end this series and the way it played out, I imagine that's what we're getting. The only knock I can find on the movie is the dialogue of Bullock and Trixie(midwestern Shakespeare) seemed a bit out of character for them as they were never that eloquent. I would've liked to see a certain couple characters developed slightly longer before they were killed off, but I don't have any regrets. It's quite frankly one of David Milch's masterpieces, and I hope he delivers a 2nd and 3rd movie because I could watch this over and over again. It's unfortunate that Powers Booth passed away, along with a couple other characters missing, and couldn't be a part of this. 10/10 for me. Every great show should have a great conclusion like this.",4943998,Deadwood

61084524,11 October 2019,Great movie with great acting and production values. I especially liked Timothy Olyphant - I thought he was an absolute star in Justified and I expected to see a lot more of him since.Just a tip for others who have yet to watch it and also something to consider for makers of future films...As much as I admire what I assume is intended to be 'period authentic' language I found the dialogue very difficult to understand at times. This was in part due to the audo itself and sometimes the pace. About a third of the way into it I decided to turn on the subtitles and it quickly became clear why I has been struggling.,4943998,Deadwood
67910893,6 August 2019,"Loved it. It had the grand slow burn, refined, yet savage storytelling the series had. All the actors are once again telling the show, Mcshane chief of all. It has a more coherent plot, more of a quicker pace, which is a problem hadf with the series, at times I felt it dragged a little to far. Nonetheless, this story is unique. The feel of the Deadwood camp makes it feel like something right out of another universe of it's own creation. The writing is rich, the way we see the current inner workings, still strong. It's a great sendoff to a great work of art.",4943998,Deadwood

27083426,27 June 2019,"Thank you HBO for this movie and a proper conclusion, not being possible otherwise, to the series. However, there was so much more to show, to say and to do here. Many questions with forever lost answers. Therefore only 9 stars. Don't get me wrong here. I've watched the movie (or a long episode actually) immediately after all three seasons of the series (all recorded and stored) but still there's a big hole in-between. The cast, writing and direction, music, editing and all still done impeccably (like Serenity for Firefly), yet I miss all of this. It's hard to accept its ending. All in all, TV rarely sees such fantastic development of even the smallest character role, such great performances and a job so well done overall. However, and no matter how improbable/impossible, you still owe us at least two seasons. Business shall not overpower pure art. Mind that.",4943998,Deadwood
8663513,23 June 2019,"No matter how this movie was made it would always leave you wanting more just like the series did, which ended far too early. There were so many great stories and characters in the series that playing them out would not be possible to do in a completely satisfactory manner in a 2 or even 6 hour time span. That all said, this movie remains true in heart and soul to the fabulous series. After the credits roll you will find yourself not just wanting more but more in love with the characters and their stories than you felt before. There is some closure here, excellent closure that makes you feel quite good yet melancholy and curious, which is very much like a good life that has been well lived. Though it is not without painful tragedy - much like every single life story in its entirety - there is beautiful hope and that great rarity of true justice. Without naming any names, the truly despicable, heartless character, whose type is almost always untouchable in real life, gets a bit of well deserved justice, even if it would obviously be only a temporary phenomenon. What makes a movie great are fascinating characters that you care about, living intriguing moments you can witness, and leaves you thinking not only about what will happen next for them next but also how it reflects upon your own life, feelings, and experiences. Every real life has its share of harsh cruelty, moments of great love and tenderness, and leaves you wanting more for both those alive and those who are not. If it has been a great life, in the end you feel love, hope, and the possibility of real justice. Deadwood delivers this very well, which you will realize as its stories grow on you the more you think about it and when you view it again. Whether you loved and saw the series or not, don't pass this movie by. It offers the same satisfaction of a life well lived.",4943998,Deadwood

2510120,13 June 2019,"God I loved this movie. Deadwood was a beautiful, well written, gritty view into the much romanticized old west. Although it borrowed events from the actual town, it wasn't really what you'd call historically accurate. But it was authentic; a glimpse of where this nation came from as it was on the cusp of entering the modern world we're more familiar with.The show was amazingly well written and acted, with rich three dimensional characters that largely resisted the traditional labels of good and bad for more realistic depictions of a community finding a balance in a hard, unforgiving environment that bred hard, unforgiving people.It was fantastic, but because of that authentic human portrayal it could get a little depressing. The show never shied away from the fact that sometimes bad deeds go unpunished or that the winner take all nature of life on the frontier meant that powerful people could literally get away with murder and establish dynasties by doing so. On the one hand it was part of why I loved the show, but on the other it made for kind of a bummer finale.This movie is the finale I would have loved to get a decade ago. It brings back your favorite characters, heroes, villains, and in between, for one last quick glimpse of the famous town. Many of the unresolved plots left dangling when the show ended are spun up and given some resolution. Love triangles are resolved, characters find closure for their turbulent pasts, villains get their comeuppance,and the town gets ready to move into the modern era as it officially becomes part of the US and gets hints of things to come like phone lines.If the original show stretched things with respect to the true events of Deadwood, the movie really pulls things beyond recognition to provide some closure for many favorite characters. Multiple historical characters get revised endings that are fan service rather than any resemblance to the truth, and I loved every minute of it. It was so great to see the characters again and see them grow as people to the point where you could imagine something approaching a happy ending for them.My personal favorite was Calamity Jane, the tortured alcoholic mess with a heart way too big for living in the wild west. Seeing her come to grips with her past was awesome. I will always be grateful that HBO opened the purse to make this love letter to the fans. If you watched the original show, I think there's at a solid chance you'll really like the movie. If you didn't, go back and watch the show and then watch the movie. Together they are a perfect combination.",4943998,Deadwood

117877520,4 February 2021,"This should have been a great wrap up to a great series. The villain comes back to town for one last showoff with our aged heroes. But most of it was filled with flashbacks &amp; revisiting old fan favorite character traits. Unlike some other reviewers i liked the idea of revisiting aged characters who have lost some of their younger edge. However it seemed like too much time was spent reintroducing characters and where they have been. This could have been done much quicker and more organically so the final plot could take center stage. I feel like this caused the plot to suffer since there wasn't much time devoted to building things up to a grand final showdown. Instead the tension felt more on a simmer with even major developments not quite boiling like they did in the original series. On top of that they ending had very little closure. It felt like there was still more to tell. Will there another movie? Doubt it, so why not really finalize more of the character's stories?In the end the movie is better than no movie at all. It does explore and or hint at some of the character's final stories. But if i was to sum up my feelings on the movie as the finale of a great HBO series it would be: ""the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper""",4943998,Deadwood

Plot doesn't really matter, it's the ambience that's important, and resolution of unfinished business.Like many, I have issues with the pseudo shakespearian prose which I think is overdone and pretentious. The Man Who Would be King does it better.What rings true is the ambience of the time in goldfields settlements, and how human beings actually lived in that environment. The moving conclusion with waltzing matilda connects to the gold rushes in Australia, and the universality of those experiences. It's an unexpected but brilliant coda to the whole series.",4943998,Deadwood

8338987,5 July 2020,"The reviews of this title are very mixed if you have a scroll through the most helpful reviews on IMDB and this is no surprise and I will explain why.First of all, the brilliant aspects of this movie return to the realms of Deadwood.The movie is produced and written by most all of the same people who were involved in the original TV show as such they know the story, they know the mood and they know the dialogue/characters very well.Some people complained about the dialogue in the reviews here but perhaps have forgotten that the TV show had a lot of western and Shakespeare vernacular as well you just don't notice it as much as it is spread over multiple episodes and thus less concentrated. I think the writers in doing a movie have ended up compressing the dialogue and thus you get a lot more of this type of dialogue than we are used to so close together.As these are the original writers &amp; producers they also have clearly taken some risks with the movie by focusing on some character arcs which they were unable to fully explore in the show and I find this quite alright, these are major side characters that they did build up for future plot lines and clearly they were frustrated with being unable to finish these character arcs and used the film to do so.Now as for the disappointing, a lot of people do not realise this but think back (or re-watch) the first season of any of your favourite TV shows and then see how much better the actors perform their roles in the following seasons. This is natural as for big TV shows these actors perform year round almost on that show and the longer the show runs the more years these actors get to perform as those characters. More years means better performances with more natural emotions and dialogue sequences as well as much better on-screen synergy between the different actors.This movie was made about 10 years after the show finished (cancelled or whatever reason it was?) and as such these actors have not performed these characters in over 10 years thus the on-screen synergy is of course missing and you see the actors really trying to recapture the character they knew they played 10 years ago. No doubt if this was a TV show the performances would have gotten better over the series run but as it is a movie we are locked in essence to that first season feeling.Lastly it seemed the writers still want to revisit Deadwood further, without spoiling anything - the ending definitely had a ""to be continued"" vibe to it with yet further key plot points utterly and completely up in the air. With yet new key plot points added to the story that now also need resolution.Will we perhaps see a Deadwood 2 film or a new Deadwood TV show at any time in the future? I certainly hope that this is not the end of Deadwood with yet so much left unanswered.",4943998,Deadwood

When Utter declines, he ends up dead and a black man is the principal suspect but he was also a witness that needs to be silenced.A dying Al Swearengen and Marshal Seth Bullock have unfinished business with Hearst.Watching this the film, it has themes explored by the film McCabe and Mrs Miller.

It is one of my favorite series and the way it was left due to the rift between parties involved kind of left fans with a disheveled ending. This finally corrects course as far as I am concerned.

The costumes and makeup are so good, and it's been 10 years, so everybody looks so different. Big kudos to HBO and David Milch for giving the fans what they have been drooling for.

There isn't a lot happening, and there's dialogue and character relations that's not very compelling. It appears that you have to be very into the TV series to get anything out of it, which may explain the high score here on IMDB - a score that the movie itself has no right to. The actors might possibly have done well had they had interesting material to work with. However, the left overs from a TV series appears hollow and without much meaning.As for what the movie is about, apart from the mentioned relations that are impossible to care about if you aren't a follower of the series, there is the rich and arrogant criminal senator who wants a piece of land to erect telephone poles on, against the common folk of the town. This is, if anything, the main story arc, but we get no great insight in it, and most importantly, no kind of resolution of that.

31368511,5 June 2019,"This is an excellent send off for the beloved T.V. show cancelled way too early and it's a very fitting rebuttal to the Game of Thrones finale. While GoT was rushed and threw away nearly everyone's character arcs, the Deadwood movie satisfyingly crams in nearly every major/minor character in the span of two hours, giving everyone their own character moment; Everything feels so natural and smooth.The writing is perfect as usual weaving beautiful shakespearean soliloquies with foul language, it's a beautiful/rich tapestry for the ears.The actors haven't skipped a beat and are incredible, it's sad seeing how old everyone's gotten, but then again they've continued growing in the 13 years since we last saw them. Al and Bullock are wonderful, Hearst is as devilish as always, Doc, Jewel, Sol, Trixie, Charlie, Calamity, are great; it's just so nice so see all these characters again.The only problems I had with this film is minor editing &amp; special effects. There are several mini flashbacks to the original show that I felt are unneeded especially if you watched the series prior to seeing the film. There's also some CGI shots that didn't look terrible, but not that good; like the opening train shot. Also at the end there's a snow effect that looks unbelievably bad and phoney.Aside from these small gripes the film is beautiful and nearly flawless, it also provides closure on one of the greatest pieces of media ever made.",4943998,Deadwood

It is like somehow your old days have come to life again and all seems magical, seeing most of the characters in their perfect roles, the accent the mud the wooden establishment and everything about the old Deadwood is still wonderful.

80693802,1 June 2019,"This is a trip down memory line, more than ten years later from the show's ending we get the sequel that we have looked forward and are deserved, with the whole cast returning except for three people where two are sadly deceased, it's just remarkable how David Milch and the crew behind the movie created this masterpiece. From the huge amount of detail in every scene to the dialogue as it's just as good as it was in the TV show. The production design and sets are perfect, you get immersed the second the movie starts and we get to go through a ride of a life time into the western in a more modern look on Deadwood. Daniel Minahan directed the TV Movie and he did a stunning job, right candidate for the job but at first I wanted Ed Bianchi but Daniel did a remarkable job and did it justice.The story of this sequel is a continuation of sorts from the third season that had George Hearst as an unlikely but terrifying villain played brilliantly by Gerald McRaney and he does as an incredible job in this. It's suspenseful seeing his evil plans unfold, he is still a big cocksucker in this and it makes for some great suspense that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Other than the fantastic villain we get lots of incredible character moments, everyone shines and nails the dialogue perfectly with something new and fresh to their roles. The movie has something for everyone as it's just amazing, recommended to fans of Deadwood or for new comers as it tells the major plot arcs through small flashbacks which makes you understand how the characters feel and what is on their mind which ultimately helps us the viewers.",4943998,Deadwood

This one does it pretty well.It's sad seeing the aging of the characters and the actors. That's life.As always, the Deadwood story has great villains, heros, good guys and bad guys, writing, action, editing, direction, timing, and story telling.Bullock has absorbed some of Raylan Givens' cool and tough personality qualities, and I suspect may have been one of Raylan's ancestors.If you love Deadwood the series you'll enjoy Deadwood the movie.",4943998,Deadwood
104152084,16 June 2019,"First of all, if you haven't watched the original series, do not bother watching this as this is rather a sequel than a stand-alone movie that does not explain anything and relies on its viewers to already be into each character's stories prior to watching the film. If you HAVE watched the series... you'll provably end up being even more disappointed as this is pure unentertaining garbage compared to its predecessor. Almost everything went wrong with this one. So, where to begin?
Firstly, it would be nice to somewhat introduce the viewer to the history of Deadwood and its characters back from the series filmed more than ten years ago. Instead, first half of the movie the viewer is forced to either guess (if he didnt witness the series) or struggle to remember what the story is all about based on all the long, boring, confusing and unexplaining dialoges this movie is full of.
Secondly, there is little to no dynamics in this. So, after witnessing the first half and struggling to find anything possible or worth understanding, you just give up and wish this movie ended as quickly as possible. You want some action, a clever story, an entertaining plot... Instead you get almost 2 hours that feel like an eternity of talking, talking, talking, and again - TALKING. Boring, forced, all these characters whose motivation makes no sense makes you feel like they're here just to practice the art of eloquence, not to actually do something. There is no development of the plot. There is no clarity of what this is all about and why you are forced to suffer like this watching this meaningless parody of a movie.
Close to the middle of the film, finally some action happens, as there is an intrigue between the evil senator and the people of Deadwood concerning an important piece of land near the town. But once you start to hope and actually be interested for the first time in the run of the movie, guess what - everything is interrupted yet again by weak drama and, of course, talking. We dont want a local whore arranging her wedding throughout a third of the screentime, we dont want to follow a story of a female lesbian cowboy getting drunk in the bar talking and doing God knows what. We want an actual, entertaing, dynamic PLOT, but there is none of that in this steaming heap of a film.
Dont waste your time, avoid this.",4943998,Deadwood

68537482,15 July 2019,"Deadwood: The Movie is a like a season of Deadwood condensed to the length of a movie for better or worse. A lot happens so viewers can't complain about being bored and the characters are all portrayed in the same way that they were before. I can't imagine it's easy to go back to a role from literally a career ago for some of the actors.
The problem with the movie format is that when you try to pack so much into such a short format (compared to TV) it usually seems rushed or sloppy. I think Deadwood: The Movie suffers from this. The driving force of the show, besides the acting, is the story. The writers had a lot to say but I don't think there was enough time to say it. It comes off as rushed or a bit sloppy, in my opinion. It's nice that there is some closure for the characters, though.
In my opinion, Deadwood was never the greatest show there was. It never took too many chances in terms of film. It was revolutionary at the time just like other things HBO was doing but, to me, it was just a narrative on camera. It was an interesting story but it I don't think it was anything overly special.",4943998,Deadwood
11532146,29 June 2019,"Full review is pasted below along with a link to my blog where I have the same things written just with a few photos.kunalatthemovies.movie.blog/2019/06/25/deadwood-the-movie-spoiler-free-review/Let's get going.
Deadwood: The Movie is written by David Milch and directed by Daniel Minahan. Deadwood was originally a TV show on HBO that ran from 2004-2006. It is still one of the highest rated and reviewed dramas of all time, and one of my personal favorite shows ever. It is one of the few shows I have ever given a 10 out of 10. The show was created and produced by David Milch who also wrote and produced the movie which released on May 31st, 2019 on HBO as part of the HBO Films productions. If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing the original show from 2004, I am sorry to tell you that this film will make no sense neither will it have any sort of emotional impact on you. However I sincerely urge anyone who hasn't watched it, to try their level best to watch the show anyway they can. For international audiences the show is available on Amazon Prime and for American audiences it is available on HBO Go. If you enjoy a good drama series with flawless dialogue and character development set in a wild west frontier backdrop, this is a show waiting to be watched by you. I am well aware that the show has not been watched by many people which is why I took the release of the film as an opportunity to hopefully praise the show and it's attempt at a conclusion with the movie.
Original poster of Deadwood Season 3 from 2006
I cannot praise the show enough, but this isn't a review of the show, this is a review of the movie. Now without any spoilers, the movie picks up in 1889, 10 years later where we left off with our characters from the show, naturally all the characters have evolved and so has the set pieces. What I loved about the show was the creation of the town of Deadwood (which is a real town in South Dakota) and the sets they made for the show. It was the most realistic and lived in set piece on television that I had seen at the time. The movie takes that same look and feel and expands on it making lavish set pieces. Since the original show had a much smaller budget, the movie was able to further expand on details with the costumes and props.The creation of Deadwood for the movie.
One thing I have to admire about the movie is that they made the entire set, both interior and exterior, from scratch again. Now while the sets are bigger and more elaborate than the show, for me it somehow felt more artificial. It didn't have that wild west frontier town dirt and grime from the show. That is also because this is 10 years later and the town is more ""civilized"" and is being celebrated into its statehood of South Dakota. But still for me it looked and felt like a set and not as real and lived in as the set in the show during 2004-2006. That is just me nitpicking because I am in love with the show and admire everything they did with it. The movie does do a good job in bringing everything and everyone back together again to try to give some closure. Instead of closure, I just wanted more, more movies or perhaps another season. As of now there aren't any plans but I hope the success of the movie greenlights a new/farewell season to properly wrap things up. Because for me, as enjoyable as the movie was, it didn't give me a sense of closure.
Seeing Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) together on screen again was a true delight. Their chemistry in the show is further enlightened in the movie. Another little interesting tidbit about the show, it is based on a true story about actual lawmen and gunslingers migrating to the volatile town of Deadwood, and how that mixed bag of personalities kept under pressure in a town can lead to intense drama unfolding. Basically ""this town ain't big enough for the both of us,"" and that is the relationship of Seth Bullock and Al Swearengen, a lawman and a corrupt business owner. I can't help but love Al Swearengen, his portrayal by Ian McShane is flawless, seriously one of the best characters written for television. We expect him to be the villain of the show and movie, but he just wins the hearts of the viewers instead.The music in the movie is just great, they recreated the theme from the show and they even brought back the original song Hog of the Forsaken. The whole movie is basically one large nostalgic trip for fans like me, complete with flashback scenes. I understand why they added them, the last episode of the show aired in 2006, but since I had just rewatched the whole show again I found the flashbacks detached me from the narrative. I was satisfied with the 2 hour runtime, it didn't bore me at all but it also didn't make me feel like this is the end. I felt the same after the movie as I did after season 3 of the show; wanting more, wanting a conclusion and proper send off.Rating:
I'm giving Deadwood: The Movie an 8.5 out of 10.
This movie is very enjoyable for a fan of the show, but if you have watched the show and aren't a fan, this movie won't do much to convince you otherwise. The movie doesn't add much more to what already exists in Deadwood, but for me that's not a bad thing since the show was perfect. Sometimes less is more and I can see some people wanting more out of this movie. I really do hope they make another season/mini-series/movie of Deadwood, this is a franchise that deserves more recognition.",4943998,Deadwood

As if HBO had not already disappointed millions of fans of a certain other big show thats been around for a while, which shall not be named, but it has incest, breasts, some nether parts, and...well a throne. So aside from all other hbo shows, its got a throne...BUt aside from THAT particular show, this was yet another example of a terrible way to end a great franchise.
Less than 2 hours is not enough of a way to finish such a good time as Deadwood was. True its bee many years for a lotta folks, Saying its been only 10 years in story when the last episode of the series was in 2006. What, they couldnt just say "" oh, its been roughly 13 plus years""? Terrible way to end it. No real passion, no caring from the writers. Luke warm. 5/10",4943998,Deadwood

106789153,9 July 2020,"I must have seen a different movie than many of the viewers here, because I thought it was terrible. Reunions seldom work, and this one squarely did not. It was nothing more than regurgitated and repackaged George Hearst storylines from the 3rd season, with a flimsy ""sort of"" ending tacked on.As in the series, Calamity Jane is the most over-the-top and annoying character, with more time devoted to her lesbian affair than to Charlie Utter or Al Swearengen storylines.My advice...skip this mediocre movie.",4943998,Deadwood
26226712,5 June 2019,"I've always liked Deadwood without loving it; I'm happy to admit that I'm not the hugest of fans. That being said, Ian McShane's performance as Al Swearengen is among my favourite TV performances of all time (maybe only second to James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano). Also, I did love season 1, and for the most part liked 2 and 3, but they continually introduced new characters and took focus away from the one's I initially loved, and this got frustrating. I think it also led to the show collapsing under its own weight, and getting infamously cancelled after 3 seasons, when I believe the creator wanted to do at least 4.So I went into this movie with moderate expectations, and had them for sure exceeded. This was an incredibly satisfying, humorous, and at times quite emotional epilogue for the beloved characters that inhabited the town of Deadwood. The focus on the core characters- the one's I loved from the first season, more or less- as well as the wonderfully hate-able George Hearst proved to be a relief. No agonisingly dull theatre troupe subplots here, folks.Another point of relief- to be honest- were the flashbacks used throughout the film. I think if I'd watched the series more recently than about six years ago I may have found myself frustrated by their inclusion, but since it's been some time and I've watched so many more films and tv shows since, I found them immensely helpful.If you loved or liked or even tolerated Deadwood's TV run I can almost guarantee you will come away satisfied. If you've never seen the show before, this probably won't prove to be much more than an above average western (albeit one with some very funny and creatively profane dialogue, as well as a handful of reliably strong performances).I'm very thankful this is now how the show has ended. It's not the most perfect, earth-shattering finale to a TV series I have seen, but it's much better than how it had ""ended"" before, and it reminded me of all the good times I spent being entertained by the first 3 seasons of this sometimes flawed but ultimately very compelling and well-crafted show.",4943998,Deadwood
81090483,13 October 2019,"Although this production has a lot of unnecessary profanity, the characters seem to try to reach beyond themselves to somehow do good.

People need to know the Lord, there is no other hope...",4943998,Deadwood

I was unbelievably excited to find out a movie/finale was coming.That's where my excitement ended.I watched 45 minutes of this, got interrupted, and I've never finished it. Maybe I should, and maybe it's not fair to review something I didn't finish, but I don't for a second feel like I'm missing out. It was boring, slow, and seemed like the plot was contrived and forced just to make the movie. The great lines, humor and delivery of the show seem to have been left in the show.",4943998,Deadwood
111010862,23 January 2020,"Normally, I don't watch this types of movies a lot, right now I'm glad that I have seen this particular movie. This is a very genuine western story,not very full of surprises. Even in some place you can predict what is gonna happen next. Despite some shortcomings, I liked the film because the plot was very simple but the way it was put forth was pretty amazing. In the conclusion, I feel like there should have been more cigarettes to inure the story,specially the characters. Although It may seem funny, but believe it or not that's the major thing I missed in the entire movie.",4943998,Deadwood
438066,30 December 2019,"I found this movie on DVD at my local library. It apparently was made in response to fans of the older series wanting more.First I must say that even though this is a freshly made movie the production values are marginal at best. The picture has a soft focus look to it, like an older low-resolution film. It was distracting at first.I decided to watch this tonight as it has many actors I admire. I gave it a full 30 minutes, well maybe 33 in all, before I ejecting the DVD. Why you may wonder? The script has virtually all the characters using filthy language during normal dialog, so much so that it became distracting very quickly. If I watch this sort of movie, set in 1889 South Dakota, I want to be entertained. Having characters use too much filthy language is not entertaining, it is just a lazy substitute for good writing.Now I realize all Deadwood fans will vote my review ""not helpful"" and that is OK, I just want potential viewers to recognize upfront that the script has pervasive filthy language and if that is not your preference then you might as well skip it.",4943998,Deadwood
9303183,20 August 2019,"I am grateful that HBO made this movie. Die-hard fans of the series (like me) have been waiting for the finale, and despite its flaws, we will enjoy it at some level.I understand that David Milch was already suffering from dementia as this story and script were still in development, and this might account for some of the differences in the series vs. the movie that others have already observed. We can only hope that Mr. Milch will continue to have good days.My major ""complaint"" involves the story line: It focuses on Sen. George Hearst, who was introduced in Season 3. I did not like the story line then, and I do not like it now. It was forced. And Hearst's dialogue was contrived. No one spoke like that then, or speaks like that now.I think it would have been far more entertaining if the producers had focused, instead, on Seth Bullock's new friendship with Teddy Roosevelt, a friendship that would last for 35 years until President's Roosevelt's death in 1919. Many story lines could have evolved out of that friendship.Very little was said about silver mining. Without mining, Deadwood would not exist. It is unrealistic to suppose that a mining tycoon like Hearst would devote his time to the installation of telephone poles.It strains credulity that Anna Ellsworth would actually have any plans for Charlie Utter's land. What a strange way for her to bow out of the movie.Dan Dority has obviously aged (and gained weight) and is no longer assigned the menacing role he had in the series. He has no presence.One or two of the scenes involving Joanie Stubbs (who is wasted in this movie) should have prompted a flashback to Powers Booth, who played one of the pivotal roles in the television series.Doc Cochran has some screen time, but Tom Nuttall (who owns Saloon No. 10) has very little. Nuttall was one of the most interesting minor characters in the series.E.B. Farnum, the court jester, starred in the series, but hardly has time to reintroduce his character in the finale.Which brings me to Calamity Jane Cannary. Yes, her role in the movie was disproportionate to her ""minor"" role in the series. But, rather than finding fault with that, I felt that her role was indispensable in bridging relationships between characters and in bringing the series back to life. Her recital of what happened to Wild Bill in Saloon No. 10 is priceless. She is my favorite character in the movie.I gave this a 7. That is not a bad rating. The film is enjoyable, and a lot of effort went into it. It was not possible to conclude a three-year series in two short hours. That expectation could not be met. It was too ambitious. But, it was worth the try. A ""Bravo!"" to all concerned.",4943998,Deadwood

He uses the opportunity to make Charlie Utter an offer on his property. When Utter declines, things take a dark turn.I never got into Deadwood the series, so was unfamiliar with the characters and history involved. Despite this, I found the story easy to follow and not too reliant on the series. You don't have to be familiar with the series to follow or enjoy the movie.So, a good standalone movie: decent plot, solid performances and direction. Initially it does appear that the movie is just going to be a closure exercise for fans of the series but from a point it becomes very interesting in its own right.This said, there are some scenes which will probably have more meaning to series watchers (e.g. the wedding certainly seemed that way to me). In addition, there are some plot contrivances which seem to be there merely to prolong the movie. The ending feels rather abrupt, with the main plot still half up in the air.So, not brilliant, but reasonably good nevertheless.",4943998,Deadwood

The lead character Dominic was like most of the folks in media industries that serve some great big unseen master. We put our noses to the grindstone, put our hearts on the paper for the elusive ""win"", yet we overlook the damage we potentially could be causing to the world. And what damage they have done. I found out things I hadn't known before, like the role of the Mercers being behind both big data companies, thus guaranteeing their influence on the referendum. And that is where I started to pull on my guts. That they had not only done it to England but had done it to America; manipulated politics, empowering an element of society that we should be leaving in the dark cellar of the 20th century. The fear of the other on an ever shrinking world controlled by ever more powerful and terrible titans is a regression. But the story is still being told and we will know the conclusion... maybe.

15148330,20 January 2019,"... in that your social media data can not just be harvested to sell you hats and hamburgers, but sell you misinformation literally tailored to you for political campaigns as well.This is the tale of the 2016 referendum on Brexit- the vote in the UK to leave the European Union. Specifically it is a portrait of one man, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), the director of the ""Leave"" campaign, or the campaign to exit the EU. I wasn't sure why the side story of the Cummings marriage and pregnancy was included at first, but later it becomes clear that Cummings would have come across as a statistician/political version of House, M.D. if that humanizing story was not present.Cummings enlists the help of a tiny Canadian IT company - Aggregate IQ - to do data mining of social media for the ""Leave"" campaign, and they come up with three million potential Brexit voters that the ""Remain"" campaign (campaign to remain in the EU) knows nothing about. Cummings' strategy involves tenets of Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" , specifically forcing the ""Remain"" campaign to ""fight in the darkness"", or wherever the ""Leave"" campaign chose them to fight. Specifically Britain has an equal time policy when it comes to political messages. So the Remain campaign would have a Nobel prize winning economist explaining the downside to leaving the EU in complex terms, and then the Leave side would talk about millions of Turks possibly emigrating to the UK, forcing the Remain side to waste time on trying to debunk that message.It is up the viewer as to whether this tale is humorous or frightening, I think it is a little bit of both. On the frightening side you have political campaigns becoming the equivalent of the evil presence in the 1982 film Poltergeist - it knows what scares you. On the humorous side you see the frustration of the Remain side as the Leave side will simply not play by the rules. And kudos to the guy playing Boris Johnson. He looked just like him.I'm only knocking one point off this almost perfect film because it had quite a bit of stuff that the viewer was just assumed to know. For example it kept talking about ""MPs"". In the US that is ""Military Police"". In the UK it is ""Members of Parliament"". I should not have to search Wikipedia in order to completely understand a film, but overall that is a minor complaint.Highly recommended,and this is NOT a piece of propaganda.",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War
11203482,26 January 2019,"Other reviewers praise or knock this film based on whether they supported Leave or Remain.But this is a great film because (1) the plot, characters, acting and pace are superb and (2) it illuminates the role data analytics now play in politics (and all advertising). Like it or not, DA is here to stay because it is extraordinarily more efficient in delivering a message effectively.The key elements of the Leave/Remain debate in these reviews can be boiled down to 3 incidents in the film (1) the line ""Obama led the way,"" (2) the Remain focus group which descends into anarchy and complete honesty with a housewife sobbing about having been completely abandoned by her country's economy and culture (whose views are shared by at least 3 others in the group), and (3) the aftermath of the focus group in which the Remain campaign leader concludes that the feelings of the Leave voters are due not to them having valid complaints, but because the Leave leaders must have been waging their campaign surreptitiously for 20 years.The pièce de résistance of sophistry is the single card disclosure at the end that the Mercer family is tied to both data analytics companies used by the Leave campaign. Data analytics is a tool that was used by Obama (a liberal) and by the Leave campaign (conservatives).

39229604,12 January 2019,"In the run-up to the 2016 referendum, nobody in the UK - or elsewhere, for that matter - genuinely believed that Vote Leave would win (similarly to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election result). It seemed more or less incomprehensible that Remain would be defeated. This is arguably evidenced by the fact that there were no rules set out for the referendum and the meaning of its outcome (e.g. that it should require more than a measly 2% majority to invoke such major Constitutional upheaval) and that David Cameron resigned almost immediately thereafter.This energetic and witty film explores just how the rug was swept out from under us all, and highlights how dangerous social media can be when used as a weapon. Unsurprisingly, Benedict Cumberbatch gives yet another engrossing performance, with an impressive and entertaining ensemble as well.Whether you were politically-engaged in relation to the referendum or completely overwhelmed by all the jargon (and utter lies), this is an insightful drama well worth a watch.

The fact is a majority of people in the UK do not have such a self interest. But the elite today are no different than the feudal lords. Feudal lords were the expert class of their day. They after all were the educated and literate. Does that mean their decisions were in everyone's interest? hardly.

In Vice, Dick Cheney is shown to be a ruthless, calculating politician who uses focus groups, polls and statistics to beat his opponents. In Brexit, Dominic Cummings does much the same thing but relies heavily on social media to swing votes his way.A movie like this just highlights the arrogance of many math geeks, especially the ones I met at university. Anyone with a basic education can look at numbers and draw conclusions from them. It takes someone who gets out of the house once in a while and does something to understand the whole story. You have to be an incredibly arrogant person to think the average voter is like some NPC waiting to be told what to do or how to think. It just doesn't work that way.We're shown Dominic acting like an eccentric genius, writing on walls, talking down to anyone stereotypically less intelligent than he is, with visual cues like gray hair, working class clothing, skin color, uptight, etc. He's supposed to be some genius that fooled everyone into voting for Brexit against their best interest.So, alright then, if this was the case, why was there even a vote on Brexit to begin with, LOL? It would never have happened if most people loved it! Clearly, the vote happened because much of the population wanted it to. So, to whomever made this movie, how in the world do you expect to fool people into thinking Dominic had to go to the lengths he did to win the Leave vote? All you can really do is convince the swing voters to go your way on election day. Really and truly, that may be like winning an NBA game by 20 points instead of 10; you're still going to win even if you didn't go the extra mile.This is a movie that will probably not age well. In fact, that's all but assured. Hilary thought she had geniuses working for her that would help her easily coast to victory. On election night, she was embarrassed. All the guys she employed like Dominic and the tech guys were just a waste of money and time. Why? Simple fact is, she's not a likable person, she has a vile personality and on the issues, Trump knew what the voters wanted. Hilary had top strategists; why not copy what worked for Trump? She couldn't do that because she's not a robot willing to do anything to win like you see in the movies, she has personal political convictions and beliefs. The only thing is, like with Obama, Trump's beliefs were what the voters wanted and he was a far more sympathetic candidate.This movie is sadly just not an accurate depiction of an actual campaign.

The film focuses primarily on the Vote Leave campaign, which makes sense as said campaign was anything but conventional.The film accurately explains the strategy behind Vote Leave's achievement of that which was previously thought unthinkable. The campaign utilised modern techniques of reaching voters which exploited the data we choose to make freely-available online. The sophistication of strategy depicted and Vote Leave's underdog status from the beginning of their campaign will definitely have some remain voters finding themselves rooting for the other team (despite their positions differing).Although admittedly somewhat dramatised, Brexit: The Uncivil War truly does illustrate that recent political events have changed Western politics permanently.

98630346,3 February 2019,"I liked this movie a lot in spite of the slightly heavy-handed liberal bias. Benedict Cumberbach was not a great choice as he was for Remain and while a great actor, it's tough to completely forget your bias. The negative view of the Exit side comes through as they are imagined as unsophisticated rubes with no world view. What far too many forget is that a nation has the right to choose it's destiny, elect it's own leaders, and not be subjected to un-elected bureaucrats who may well only care about blind pursuit of power or lining their own pockets. Personally, I like the fact that European nations are all different and have their own history and identity.

No way one can take away credit to him for carrying the movie as he does. But even Cumberbatch can only do what the script allows him to do, and the script of this movie is just brilliant in capturing the linguistic, contextual and political vernacular of the situation the story exists in. Most characters other than Cumberbatch's also have fantastic lines, especially his Remain counterpart. It doesn't matter what the politics of this movie are, it just rings so true of the egos of people in public life, the deceptions, the moral conflicts, the tension, the loyalties and betrayals, the living rough and tumble of political campaigns. An incredibly strong element is that it shows the lives of those citizens who felt left behind by the political establishment and thus became easy fodder for the manipulations of the Leave campaign. The pace and editing are exceptional. They evoke the lightning speed of the events it dramatises, changing by the hour almost. The movie, in other words, achieves a harmony by balancing all the main elements involved in a multimodal medium such as film, the principle Kurosawa often reminded film makers to mind above all other film making considerations. Ultimately it doesn't matter that we're watching a dramatisation of events that have already happened, so fresh and spontaneous does this movie feel. It's not a boring biopic, it's a paradigmatic example of the art of dramatisation of real events, which the Brits do so sublimely. Brilliant viewing all round.",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War

4888011,23 January 2019,"The big news in June 2016 was the referendum in the United Kingdom asking voters whether they wanted the country to leave the European Union; the referendum commonly got called Brexit (short for British exit). The referendum passed, but lesser known was everything behind the campaign. Toby Haynes's ""Brexit: The Uncivil War"" focuses on this. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the strategist figuring out how to appeal to voters using algorithmic micro-targeting. It sounded very similar to how Trump and his cohorts sought to appeal to voters in the US. After the vote, it turned out that large numbers of British citizens didn't even understand what the referendum was about. Indeed, the movie shows the Leave campaign trying to manipulate people into thinking that the problem is foreigners coming to England. The UK and US sure have a lot in common.It's not a great movie, but gives a good insight into what led British voters to vote against their own interest (not that the EU is anything to worship). Maybe so many UK voters have lost faith in their government that they don't care what happens. I recommend the movie.As to the idea that foreigners move to England and exploit its benefits, John Oliver has made quite a few jokes about how his native country has a sketchy history when it comes to race relations.",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War
345596,9 January 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDuring the summer of 2016, the nation was swept up in the fever of whether Britain should leave or remain in the European Union. Some were firmly set in one camp or the other, while many others were undecided, but a slew of public figures were fixed in the public spotlight, galvanized by this historic, once in a lifetime decision. But for the Leave campaign, it was one man behind the scenes who pulled most of the strings, in the shape of Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch), a campaign strategist, whose powerhouse approach may have swung it in their favour.The 'Brexit' vote certainly defined the summer of 2016, and in the time since then, it's held a stranglehold on the news, which has been intensifying as we build up to leave at the end of March. And so, after all the madness and sabre rattling of the vote and the subsequent aftermath, director Toby Haynes has at least picked a suitable time to offer a reflective look at a man who hardly anybody saw, but probably did more for the Brexit cause than any of the famous faces combined.Despite his established status now, its good that Cumberbatch still doesn't find appearing in homegrown, TV stuff like this beneath him, as he brings an intensity and power to proceedings here that liven them up a bit, and he has a knack for playing these eccentric, socially awkward types whom everything clings on, here portraying the kind of guy who figures adding the word 'back' to a sentence gives it its power. What's not so impressive is the interspersing of footage of real life political personalities, alongside third rate actors portraying others, giving it a cheap, low budget feel.It's all over before you know it, and while it's sharp and hits the mark where it needs you, it's not developed and fleshed out enough to leave you feeling like you've watched something with real clout. But it is an eye opener, and offers food for thought on what goes on behind the scenes that influences us more than what we see. ***",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War
127955595,5 January 2021,"Superbly acted with a good balance of humor and facts: entertaining while scary in revealing the power of data analytics.
As offensive as this production may be to the leave voters and their counterpart in the US, Brexit lays bare the dangers data analytics represent to modern democracies in targeting specific members of a population with fine-tuned real-time disinformation, exaggerations, and oversimplification to provoke that targetted member(s) sense of powerlessness, fear, insignificance, and conditioned disenfranchisement and further condition them to behave or vote a certain way. Nearly half of the reviews from the leave voters below are critical of this production because they feel it ridicules the rationale for their votes.
The movie never claims all votes were procured that way or that only the ""manipulated"" voted to leave; it makes a case for how any campaign in a somewhat equally divided choice can use such data to harvest enough additional votes from among those whose angst is known through data. Those who cannot get this concept and condemn this work have to ask themselves how a man like Trump got 10 million more votes than he got in the last election despite four years of buffoonery the entire world witnessed. If 70 million Americans can still worship Trump despite his four years in office, it is not far fetched to say a million or two votes that decided the Breixt referendum were cast by those equally manipulated.
My only disappointment with the work is that it felt it needed to show the ""human"" side of Cummings by exploring aspects of his personal life that had nothing to do with the story at hand and his complicity.",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War

3146136,11 January 2019,"The film centers on Dominic Cummings, a classic Cumberbatch character: very intelligent, socially awkward, not suffering of and insulting to fools, embarking on something like strategizing the Leave campaign mostly as an intellectual exercise. We learn how modern technology, mainly social media analytics, helped empower people who had abandoned the idea of voting and were ignored by all political sides. We see how from the data scientist perspective, using these tools to cause Great Britain to split from Europe was just a concept test, with a much larger prize as a target. That's the illuminating part.The imperfect part is that the narrative of the film is clearly a remainer one, with leavers depicted as hapless grobians and remainers as rational decent empathetic (and attractive) people. It doesn't try to understand the other side at all, leaving that job to the algorithms depicted in the film. I also question the release of the film way before the fat lady finished her song on Brexit. As such it feels spiteful: ""we lost, but they had Sherlock Holmes as strategy manager and magical algorithms that manipulate a sea of fools"". I don't like fools either and I think Britain leaving the EU is idiotic, but even so the film felt condescending to me.However, the movie is not bad and it asks (or rather induces the viewer to ask) some important questions about the future of decision making. It still falls into the category of seeing mass social manipulation as an accident, as something people do not want, when in fact all evidence points to the contrary: people post everything they know and feel so that the embracing system will give them exactly what they want. They want to be manipulated to feel better than if they were rational and not lying to themselves. For this kind of people, a movie like Brexit will not function as a warning, but as validation. It is for this reason that I rated the film a failure.

Taking back control sounds good in a slogan and any unhappiness can then easily be blamed on this membership, true or not.

The movie fails to show reality of the leave campaign and how it changed the opinions and behaviour of people and how even the lead politicians jumped on hate strategy to gain support. The facebook posts were very vile and blamed immigration for everything- lack of school places, insufficient funding of public sector, lack of resource in NHS, for traffic jams, for criminality and drug use. These messages suddenly triggered majority of British population into being very loud about those issues. You could not anymore speak any other language, but English in street and shops, otherwise you would get comments about being arogant and unable to learn to speak the language of the country. Every person with slightly darker skin than white british got told to go back to their own country on daily basis. Even if they were actually born in Britain. Then came announcement about compulsory registration and reduction of human rights for all foreign citizens. Even with very good English, people could recognize the slight accent and use the opportunity to comment and question if your own country would not be better place for you to live. This is not shown in the movie properly, but is the reality and consequence of leave campaign. Then there is the whole Murdoch enterprise and headlines in Sun, Star, Express.

However Toby Haynes's movie gave me a Hollywoodized, yet raw look into how the referendum actually passed. If anyone could pragmatically portray what Dominic Cummings initially sought to achieve through this referendum, Benedict Cumberbatch was undoubtedly the right person for this role. 92 minutes in length, the film felt like 2 minutes due to how fast-paced it moved. It almost feels surreal that Channel 4 were allowed make such a movie. It's politics from the thriller perspective.

The 14-page document, was sent to 27 million homes, responding to public demand for more details about the EU referendum by setting out the facts behind the government's position.On 14 September 2018, the High Court ruled that the advice given by the Electoral Commission to Vote Leave as requested, misinterpreted EU referendum spending laws.

Only near the end as Remain start to realise that they have ignored 3 million people for 20 years is there a hint where the 'blame' for defeat should lie.But, despite this hint, the conclusion is that the Vote Leave campaign had in some way cheated (as if when campaigning against the sitting government and full civil service it was ever a 'fair' fight from Remain). The music is also chosen as to be clear that the film is from the Remain view... with a sad 'Rule Britannia' over the victory celebrations of Vote Leave.It is however well acted, and an interesting view from a side of politics that 52% of people in the UK voted against.

2057229,24 August 2019,"I have to say it was a strange beast. Was it comedy? Was it drama? Was it the pitching of two minds, one on the leave side vs one on remain? Was it commentary on using big data?Yes, kind of all, of it. But it felt like an experimental mish-mash. Lots of ideas thrown together. This is really exemplified in a bizarre scene of the leader of the Remain campaign having a conference call while feeding some kids. It was so over the top, pointed and shot as one take that it felt like the just let the interns go away and make a short story and then bodged it in.I see some people are moaning about bias, but I felt - until the last few minutes at least where it took shifted - that it felt quite balanced. I'm quite used to the media taking a high ground so would not be surprised by bias (and I say that as a remain voter).But honestly, it is pretty balanced... they show the flaws of both sides, and the complacency of remain vs the intelligence of the leave campaign actually talking to people and using data effectively.To this day I still think remain heads are stuck in stats and GDP figures and stuff that doesn't resonate with many people. I said to the remain campaign at the time they were far too focused on responding to the leave campaign rather than setting their own stool and that proved to be entirely true. It's also addressed somewhat in this movie.Cast wise Cumberbatch is Sherlock and surprisingly one note. The rest of the cast is forgettable. And while I appreciate them not doing caricatures (and Boris was passable) some castings like Gove just felt bizarrely not at all alike. Farage felt like a bystanders to affairs, which I think is hard for anyone to really accept given his profile during the entire campaign and in continuing politics.But fundamentally as a TV movie, I'm just not sure it hit the mark for me. I'm not sure it knew what is really wanted to say... which is ironic given it's about sharp and targeted communications at its core.",8425058,Brexit: The Uncivil War

The idea of all the Disney villains being forced to live locked up (my magic) on an island by themselves does have a fun ""Escape from New York"" vibe to it, but this is the Disney Channel so there's teenybopper singing, dancing, and angst. For this installment, there is now a lottery of sorts where the children of a villains can get a a reprieve and get off the island, as did Mal, Evie, Carlos, and Jay. I found it odd how happy all the villain kids were for those chosen (this time the descendants Mr. Smee, Lady Tremaine, and Dr. Facilier's they're really desperate for villains with that one) when it wasn't them picked, but that's the good natured attitude of this film about evil people. Another annoyance is the film is padded out with some flashback musical montage sequences from the first two installments. Maybe the classic sins-of-the-father themes were an interesting starting point, as was the ""Escape from New York"" Disney villain prison island, but the songs are annoying and the petty teen drama is a lot to suffer through.

29496881,4 August 2019,"Not my demographic, but I've always been fascinated by this campy, weird little world that combines mostly the Disney fairy tale movies with children-oriented high school drama and the modern day.Though the movie suffers a little from franchise fatigue, this ain't half bad.This isn't as strong as the first two movies. (In fairness, the script is more cohesive than the first film). The individual character moments just don't have the impact and charm of the previous flicks. This probably has to do with the fact that there are just TOO many characters to juggle by now. I mean the overall story films is resolved competently, some elements and characters are just handled really quickly. If you missed Audrey, daughter of Cinderella, (played by the Charmed reboot's Sarah Jeffrey) in the second movie, you'll be pleased to see her back. But if you liked Lonnie, daughter of Mulan, (Dianne Doan) from the first two films, you'll be disappointed to see her missing. I'm guessing they just didn't have time for her.Crammed plot aside, this is an okay film. (I mean by Disney Channel Movie standards. I'd still put this near the top of them.) Story and characters are decent. The cast is strong and everyone seems like they're having fun. (RIP Cameron Boyce). I'm legitimately impressed how this movie takes itself seriously in it's own way. There is legitimate character development and use of such issues as redemption and morality. The handling of the socioeconomics of the world of Auradon, where criminals have been banished to a prison island and their kids are forced to grow up on it, is surprisingly complex and nuanced for a Disney Channel movie. (Again, by the channel's standards. The bar must be set accordingly.) If this is to be the final film, it ends the story exactly where it needs to.The movie continues one of this series' biggest selling points: Its look. Again, we are bombarded by some delightully uber-corful and whimsical sets and costumes. I know the costumes are a little nuts, but they are just so distinctive.Unfortunately, the songs go downhill. They are mostly weak or just okay. They just aren't catchy. The best in this is probably the villain song Queen of Mean, but it runs completely on style, and I don't know how many people will remember this afterwards. The dancing, however, still remains pretty impressive.Overall, if your kids liked Descendants 1 &amp; 2, they'll probably likethis.

107033342,25 August 2019,"Descendants 3 was very well crafted. It added new plots that was unnecessary. The movie did try to give a conclusion for the first and second part of its movie, however there were still many unanswered questions which lead to frustration. The villainous in this movie was frivolous to the story and the action scenes were crafted poorly. The moral Descendants 3 tried to give away was poorly given to the audience and the movie did not dig into those ideas very well. The side characters did not get any importance and many of the characters were not used at all. The music was good (for a Disney channel movie) but there were too many songs, some songs were so unnecessary.The jokes and dialogue was also not very good. The protagonist Mal was quite irksome in this movie who lies and repeats the mistake she has done in the first and second movie. However, Descendants 3 is a quite fun movie and actors like Sofia Carson, Cheyenne Jackson, Cameron Boyce and Jadah Marie acted very well. In my opinion it was still the best of the trilogy.",8022928,Descendants 3

You can hear improvement in every actors voice. Someone who really surprised me was Sarah Jeffery, she was not too bad at singing. Dove Cameron and Sofia sounded like they improved a lot.
The acting felt real and raw coming from Disney. Sofia Carson was the best actress in the movie. She really shined as Evie in this one. As well as Sarah Jeffery. She was great as Audrey.
The stakes are higher in this one and you don't forget it for a second. Every minute is pure gold.

To be honest, I feel the plot is average, the ending is predictable and the characters are not that interesting. I mean I do like Mal and Eve, they are just not quite refreshing. It is just like a million other bad girl/Cinderella movie, wild child for example. you can even match the plot turning points. I might give it a 5 if I didn't have such high expectations. For me, just waste of a good idea with completely average characters and plot.",8022928,Descendants 3

Typical angsty and unlikeable main character (Mal), falls in love with the good looking but understanding guy. Barely any plot other than that. All the main characters get on your nerves, except for me Carlos was a standout. This movie doesn't really teach kids anything, in fact, it gives them the false impression that people who have school spirit and get good grades are dorky and lame.

106523442,14 August 2019,"I know to keep my expectations moderated before going into any TV movie. Especially something that is targeted towards a young audience. As such, I knew to expect a certain level of cheese and corn in this movie. But, being that it is still obviously a ""Disney"" production, I did have some expectations. What I got from watching this movie.. was nothing but a mass of disappointment at the Disney corporation and what they think of our children today. They took iconic Disney villains and robbed them of almost all of their dignity and reduced them to the level of a running gag and a cliché. The concept of featuring a plot and story around the children of these characters does have merit and with a well written, semi-mature plot, could have been worthy of a full release.. which is not the case here. The dialogue and plot seem to have been written by a child in middle school. Many of the costumes and outfits for the characters would be better placed at the bottom of a thrift shop bargain bin. How can Disney put their well-known heroes and villains in crowns that are obviously made out of plastic and tin foil!? Some of these actors may have some creds when it comes to acting.. but almost none of them can sing or dance. Some songs are so badly lip synched that you can see the actor ""singing"" the words before you hear them. Disney please, PLEASE stop thinking that just because something is made for kids.. it has to appear and sound like it was done by KIDS. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except as something to amuse yourself with when you're drunk or to entertain yourself by mocking it.",8022928,Descendants 3

Keeping with the ""keep it simple stupid"" theme the clothing too, synthetically perfect (no dirt, wrinkles) &amp; colorful for the good people; drab wrinkled torn for the others. Hair color matched clothing in both cases. CGI was decades old cheap as were the ubiquitous colored eyes as our main special effect. A made to really make money movie.",8022928,Descendants 3
30073066,30 March 2020,"The soundtrack was fantastic, but this was just an ok plot. I was not invested in the plot. It was very thin, and just not that interesting. Audrey finally becomes an actual, complex character, and Sarah Jefferey was very fun in this role. Chayenne Jackson was fantastic as Hades, and gave James Woods a run for his money. His Hades isn't as funny as the animated one, but he did remind me a bit of the Hades from Percy Jackson. His song was one of the best in the movie. This is what I would think of if Hades was human, and modern-day. A rockstar with a cool leather jacket and mohawk who doesn't give a care! It's a shame his role was limited to less than 10 minutes total. I would have loved to see him more. Most of the songs in this movie were pretty good. Sarah Jeffrey did a good job of transitioning from good to evil in just 1 song, Hades' song was probably the best in the movie. I loved how the soundtrack mixed different styles of music flawlessly. Audery's is rap, Hades' is 70s rock, Evie's is a 50s style love ballad, Mal's is Broadway, and somehow all the different styles of music work and don't feel out of place from each other. Sadly, the soundtrack, Sarah Jeffrey, and Cheyenne Jackson are really the only good things about this movie. The plot was very thin, and kind of boring. A lot of the scenes are just argument filler, and it's clear they didn't really know what direction they wanted to go with this movie. Most of the time, I honestly didn't care what was going to happen. And the message of the movie is clearly a negative commentary on America and how we're ""discriminatory'' for not having an open borders policy. I'm sorry, but this movie was filmed in Canada. You have a Prime Minister who is running your country into the ground with his ridiculous laws and policies, so maybe work on fixing your own country before you start criticising ours? They put the bare minimum of effort into this movie. This was not nearly as creative or fun as the other 2. I still liked it, I'm still going to own it, but the soundtrack is really the only memorable thing about this movie.

Then you have this incredibly non chemistry between Emilia Clarke (one of the few from the cast you can actually meet in this documentary) and her hairstylist. She seems to ignore most of what the actor is trying to tell. It really makes you wonder about the real wibe of this team who made this show... And those pathetic ""grownup"" fans don't help to bring some intelligence to this documentary. A lot of aspects of the making is left out. You don't see anything about the GCI process but there is plenty of personal drama from the people who work there. And the highly interesting street food truck is of course a big part of it.

And they would follow these people around for a while! Like they followed the makeup artist for what felt like 10 min while she couldn't find what set she was supposed to go to. They follow this Kit Harrington obsessed extra around for a long time. They talk to the knight king, that was kinda cool.

The special effects woman in particular is as dull as ditch water-why we need to see her face timing her kid for a good 5 minutes, then whining about how hard it is being away from home, I'm not really sure.

Instead, most of the time is focused on a prosthetic artist (sure, she has a struggle by being away from their family but waay too much time is spent on this) and believe it or not on the Head of Snow, yes
the person responsiblee for coordinating the amount of snow in each of the scenesObviously these people are important for the show and convey the amount of man hours and work that going it to making, but it is not the ones I would like to hear from when such an epic journey reaches its final DestinationHBO had a small chance of giving a treat to some of the fans that were disappointed by season 8 and in my view failed to seize the opportunity6 out of 10",10090796,Game of Thrones: The Last Watch

I don't understand why people can't appreciate more about GOT this documentary showed how hard the crew and cast worked to put everything together. It's lovely how much emotions were released in this compared to Season 8 so yeah I can agree with that for sure.I absolutely love special features for films/shows so it's always a treat to see how the set was built for any scenario and how important it is to everyone involved. Some of the documentary was adorable too like with the mom &amp; child and the stunt guy plus it was awesome to see the bits with Night King. Beautiful cinematography in a few parts as well; happy to give this a 10!,10090796,Game of Thrones: The Last Watch
70872394,22 June 2019,"This documentary commits the most grave of sins for entertainment - it's boring.Did HBO not give the filmmaker proper access? The people interviewed are low-level, and while this certainly shows the more human side of the production, they are rarely featured talking about the production itself. Do you ask the make-up artist about her job and the intricacies of creating prosthetics? No. You ask her about her children. The entire documentary was basically production crew complaining from the first minute to the last. It was depressing to watch.Very little of interest was actually shown. How did the crew create the amazing settings? How much work was it for the CGI crew? How are the dragons shot and later created? How did costume decide on and create the main casts costumes? We'll never know.The four stars are for the hardworking people shown, and the occasional glimpses behind-the-scenes that I watched this for. Hats off for the stunt crew and the fascinating look at how the fake snow was created.",10090796,Game of Thrones: The Last Watch
55903810,27 May 2019,"If you thought the final season of GOT was pointless or poorly executed, this piece found a way to be even more disappointing. I learned nothing and felt nothing but indifference or a desire for it to quickly be over so I could go do anything else. Really, this could have been about any medieval show and, but for the periodic familiar face in the background, you wouldn't have known it had anything to do with GOT. It was just random clips squashed together to form a 2 hour documentary on...well I'm not really sure. I defer to my earlier observation: pointless. Any high reviews are surely from those who participated in this film or their family members.",10090796,Game of Thrones: The Last Watch

Occasionally it was a little disjointed but overall showed just how much had gone into the producing of 7 seasons of awesomeness. I particularly enjoyed the master of snow and despite me preferring Richard Brake I also enjoyed Vladimir Furyks insights into the differences between acting and stunting. As to the last read through I thought Conleth Hills and Kit Haringtons reactions were very telling and interesting, maybe the writers should have paid more attention to those reactions. All in all HUGE kudos to everyone involved I am so so so sorry that your efforts were butchered in the final scheme of things.

39517558,4 June 2019,"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, The Last Watch is one of the most moving movie experiences I can remember having in years. And the weird thing is, it didn't really hit me until about an hour after it ended. This documentary was a whole lot like the show itself, vastly different than my expectations for many episodes. I mostly expected this to show more in-depth interviews with David &amp; Dan, plenty of cast &amp; crew insight, and a bunch of behind the scenes images from the big battle episodes. Instead, D&amp;D are nowhere to be found for a good chunk, the cast comes and goes, and the doc takes most of its time telling stories from the perspectives of people you never would have thought would get screen time. And it's absolutely brilliant. Everyone from a Northern soldier extra who has been with the show for many seasons, to the hair stylist for Emilia Clarke, to the makeup artist for the white walkers, to the flippin guy making the snow every episode, this documentary moved me tears as it gave voices to people who have carried this show for close to a decade and have never seen the spotlight. Kit Harington's last speech on set &amp; seeing the hair stylist watch Clarke's last scene was the definition of bittersweet. At the very least, this should turn some fans around on this season just for how much blood, sweat, and tears was put into seeing this show succeed up until its ending. This doc was everything.

29751870,4 June 2019,"It's remarkable how such an amazing show like GOT could possibly have such a bad behind the scenes documentary. Edit out the interviews with security officers, extras, delivery people and cleaning crew then you'll be left with about 15 minutes of interesting and worthwhile content. Of course, the accents are so strong that you'll only understand about half of what's said, so if you do bother with this waste of time, you may want to turn on the subtitles.

This is quite sickening - you created an empty mess with CGI overload. We fled Hollywood in search of substance - which you briefly provided - then concluded with empty Hollywood stupid expecting praise... No. You poisoned everything. This doco does not reflect this, thus it is a failure.Bravo to the grunt workers who brought us so much joy. But those that drove the script, you will never be forgotten.

Should have invested some of that money into good writing instead of building expensive sets to destroy. Most of what ended up on the screen could have been done with simpler solutions. A good story has an internal logic and catches the heart. I guess that is why this documentary never dared to go near the story or any potentially interesting parts of the show.

58651397,27 May 2019,"It's always interesting to watch how they put together a production as big as GOT together behind the scenes. It is something that fascinates me as a huge fan of the show, but also cinema in general. There is some cool behind the scenes with the actors as well as make up and design people. Unfortunately there is nothing explaining the lack of effort that the writers put forth in the final season. The fact that they decided to not make a final 2 seasons because they were bored or thought other jobs were more important is such a shame. By being lazy they ruined what could have went down as the best show ever to still being one of the greats, but not too 3-5 IMHO. The fact that even the final episode was a bust makes things even worse because with a great finale it could have saved a mediocre season. Now I get that this special is not going to go into things like the shoddy writing it creates a platform for us as fans to still vent as to how badly they let us all down as fans. I hope that one day we can get a real explanation. As for the special it was super interesting and you gotta give the people who were behind the scenes putting these sets together and dressing and doing the actors hair and make up a ton of props.

69364382,28 May 2019,"You know, for what an absolute mess season eight of Game of Thrones was, nobody can deny that a lot of preparation, money and energy went into. Entire city sections were built, thousands of props sculpted and painted and plenty of other intricacies like ash and snow had to be manually added. If you followed the ""The Game Revealed"" short BTS films that accompanied this season of GoT, you may find ""The Last Watch"" a little less fast-paced and well-produced, but for what it's worth, its a pretty satisfying documentary that examines some pretty neat areas of the show that few people would consider.The main problem with it is that the camera chooses to linger on crew members a little too long, while not giving nearly enough insight into a given field of investigation. In some cases, these accounts are interesting and even eye-opening, because you get a personal side to this massive blockbuster production that grounds it. Other times, it may be a bit of a slog. In terms of editing, it isn't much of a masterpiece either, choosing to cut off at odd moments to transition to an all-new location.When the doc decides to show us some never before seen snippets of footage from behind the camera and some directorial insight from David Nutter and Miguel Sapochnik does it flourish. In fact, we follow a Stark soldier extra, some producers, makeup artists and even the snow SFX manager. It may seem random, but that's a good thing. It's personal, down to earth. It's easy to interpret the show as it is, a TV titan that is anything but fantasy.Of course, the stars of the show also get the spotlight occasionally, but this isn't really about them. It's about everyone behind them. Most of them anyways, who made this journey possible.If anything, ""The Last Watch"" makes me just a little more disappointed in the show for ending on a such a sour final stretch. Because so much work evidently went into it. So much dedication and time. So many logistics had to be juggled and yet the plot faltered because of poor pacing an awful writing. It's a little sad even if you think about it. As a documentary, it's imperfect, but as an experience, it's an extended glimpse into the world of filmmaking that we rarely get. It has the final say, if you will. Game of Thrones is over. There won't be any more like it.

The first to start, &amp; the last to finish. They also have wives &amp; children who they don't see from one week to the next. I know you can't get everyone in, but to feature the snow guy &amp; ignore Gordon was strange indeed. His workload expanded massively from just a prop crew in Belfast, to being responsible for all the crews, &amp; props wherever they filmed. Other than that it was an enjoyable couple of hours, liked the use of Lenard Cohens 'you want it dark' at the battle of Winterfall, pity they didn't use it in the episode. The star for me was the location manage, who to use an old expression,'swore like a trooper'!!
To finish, as an ex prop man, now retired, I was doing my usual phone around to see if anyone had any work on, I called Gordon as I'd worked on a couple of things he had been prop master on, to be told ' he wouldn't be around for a while as he was going to Belfast to do some sword &amp; sorcery thing' !!

Sure, it is a LEGO animated movie, but it is an all-together very enjoyable foray into the ""Star Wars"" universe.Secondly, and most importantly, ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" is the seasonal holiday movie that Star Wars has been waiting to get in order to erase the memory of the abysmal 1978 ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"". Just remembering having sat through that horrible experience still makes me shudder.The storyline told in ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" was very enjoyable, and especially for a ""Star Wars"" fan such as myself, this 44 minute long animated movie was just crammed with so many great - and often subtle - nods and praises to all the ""Star Wars"" movies and series with references, scenes, scenery, etc. I will say that ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" is well-worth watching more than just a single time, in order to catch all the minute details and references. Trust me, there are plenty of them all throughout the entire course of these 44 enjoyable minutes.This being a LEGO animated movie, you know that you are getting quality animation. I was just fearing that it would be an animated movie that was aimed directly at the younger audience. Luckily it was not. No, ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" is a highly watchable animated movie by audiences of all ages, fans of ""Star Wars"" or not.While they didn't have the voices of the original characters, they did have a good ensemble of voice actors to portray the various characters that we all grew up with and love. And it was nice that they actually had some of the original cast to revisit their characters; such as Anthony Daniels, Billy Dee Williams and Kelly Marie Tran.I was definitely entertained by ""The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special"" and I can highly recommend that you sit down to watch it, being a child or adult, fan of Star Wars or not, a fan of LEGO or not.

Also, there is a B-story where Poe Dameron decides to take charge with preparing the Life Day party, to disastrously funny results.It's a neat special, to be honest. It has key scenes from the prequel and original trilogy (as well as a short scene set in The Mandalorian), the special is filled with references to Star Wars meta and even contains the action Star Wars is known for and the humor Lego comes with. Also, it avoids the cheesy variety that the 1978 Holiday Special is infamous for (no cheesy comedy shorts, no questionable music numbers, and no Art Carney being important to the plot). This is a neat special for all ages, as it teaches a good moral, and is more exciting than The Rise Of Skywalker.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special

1826876,22 November 2020,"This was truly disappointing to watch. I was expecting a spoof of the original 1978 ""so bad it's good"" Star Wars holiday Special. What I ended up getting was an hour of ""The Lego Movie does a Readers-Digest version of the 9 Star Wars films in no particular order"". The target audience is obviously little kids who have only seen the sequels, as the sequel crew is the main cast. The callbacks to the Original Trilogy and the Prequels seemed like nothing more than member-berries for older family members who might also be watching. Most of the jokes fell completely flat. And though this is supposedly a Holiday Special, you'd never know it, outside of the characters repeatedly name-dropping the phrase ""it's life day"", I guess they have to REMIND the audience it's a holiday special given that nothing holiday related really takes place until the very end of the movie. If you're not a fan of the sequels, you won't like this either. The Lego Star Wars Holiday special has the stink of Disney Star Wars all over it. A Holiday special in name only, no callbacks to the original holiday special, as well as the movie itself containing very little holiday content.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
16091795,27 November 2020,"I really liked this movie/adventure.
It succeeded on 2 sides:
The first, it brought everyone's favorite characters from the whole saga.
The second, it avoided bringing JarJar (He was only mentioned once in a funny way), and that was a great thing to do :DIt was a really wonderful experience, and I did enjoy it.
Thanks to everyone who worked on it.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special

To a 7 year old starved for anyting Star Wars, it was awesome. Even today I wish I had a better copy than the one I got off Ebay. I do still watch it from time to time.This effort was probably also awesome to 7 year olds. Hopefully 42 years from now they will be talking about the disaster that they loved that was buried and never seen again except for the bad copy they got off Ebay.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special

It's clearly aimed at the youngest members of the family, but if you are a fan of Star Wars, you'll definitely find this more than enjoyable.Quite frankly, I was surprised by what a great time this turned out to be. These types of things often end up being so obviously aimed at kids that it's almost unbearable to watch as an adult. This Star Wars special manages to offer everyone something, and I was a little taken aback by how much it felt like Star Wars.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special

127370277,19 December 2020,"This ""Movie"" puts the name Star Wars to shame. The bad story itself is enough to give this 1 star. I don't even want to go into that field, but I'll speak about the Visuals. The pure fact that they tried to recreate the legofigure-but real-style from the Lego-Movie and failed so hard is sad, but the mix up of real life textures and elements to the lego world is simply unpleasing to look at.At the very best it might be OKAY to show this to a kid which just watched all the films and so maybe can get all of the bad placed references to the real star wars films. Maybe. But even then I'll give this 4 stars.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
120527803,25 November 2020,"I usually hate Lego adaptations of movies, but this was OK. Other than literally everything that includes J.J. Abrams' Star Wars, it was a fun and goofy ride revising all the previous six that were ACTUALLY GOOD. I mean, they've taken the Milleniam Falcon, Rey's taken the Skywalker name, and they think they're the Jedi masters. I like to think that movies 7, 8 and 9 never happened. And I just remember the good masterpiece George Lucas made all those years ago.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
130311280,12 March 2021,"The story is pretty much non existent and some parts of the movie might as well have been cut out to increase the pace. We do however get to see iconic scenes from the Star Wars saga recreated in LEGO form, which is something that is cool to see. The movie also seemed to poke fun at some of Disney's own decisions after picking up the franchise which I never would have expected.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
128341919,15 January 2021,"I have watched and loved all the lego star wars content such as droid tales and freemaker adventures and yoda chronicles.

65887769,26 December 2020,"Very little reference made to the original Holiday Special: A special so 'cheesy' it is ripe for hipster style ironic pastiche. This is basically a vehicle to attempt to continue to market Rey to younger StarWars fans (and I guess a range of mini-figures to Lego collectors). I don't mind the style : Mocking of nearly every other character but Rey, however they somehow have managed to make her more irritating than ever (I actually quite liked her character in the sequels- despite her preposterous untrained abilities).This seems like more evidence that Disney (or Kathleen Kennedy at least) doesn't quite get StarWars. I think they need to accept that no matter how much Disney push this character (or Finn and Poe) she/ they will never be as beloved as the OT characters (or even several of the Prequel main characters) as she just isn't as well realised. Disney should just move on.I have loved some of the previous Lego movies including Batman so as a die-hard StarWars fan since childhood (80's) I was really looking forward to this. The Jokes require you to have a really good knowledge of the 9 films and the Mandalorian (and much of the humour is either 'in-jokes' or relatively grown-up self deprecating humour) so other than it being Lego figures I'm not sure what kids are getting from it. Really disappointed.Travelling through all 9 episodes had so much potential but In hind sight it definitely felt like a waste of my time watching it. Unless you're a huge Rey fan- give it a miss.Also- it had nothing to do with 'Life Day' (Christmas).*For animated StarWars pastiche I would recommend watching the Family Guy or Robot Chicken specials.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
11018218,20 November 2020,In typical Lego fashion this movie is funny and very cheeky!! Me and my kids all enjoyed it and laughed our tails off! This is truly a good movie for parents and kids. Definitely worth the 45 minutes and I hope they make more in the future.,12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
76888172,3 December 2020,If you need to keep your kids entertained for a little bit; this will be a movie to pop on if you're a subscriber to Disney+. It's fun to watch all the timeline jumps but many of the jokes will leave you rolling your eyes or checking your phone instead. The jokes are definitely aimed at kids rather than the whole family. Better to put this on if you don't want the rugrats running around while you get dinner prepared.,12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
21170471,22 November 2020,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I wasn't excited for this special, I don't think anyone was. Lego Star Wars was okay as expected. No, I haven't seen the infamous 1978 Holiday Special that was never officially released.Lego Star Wars is a non-canon sequel to the sequel trilogy and I'm sure some fans want Rise of Skywalker to be non-canon. Rey travels to a Jedi Temple to learn more about The Force but she accidently goes time travelling. It's a simple story which loosely becomes complicated or crowded.The humor is okay, it's just there or I could say it's somewhat bland. There's plenty of kiddy humor and slapstick. No, there's no innuendo so you don't see Itchy or anyone scratching his itch.Overall, Lego Star Wars was okay. If you have Disney+, you could give it a shot or put it on your kids. It's only 47 minutes long so you won't waste much time. Maybe I will watch the other special for the hell of it.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
94289145,20 November 2020,Well one is curtuin this film is far better the that crap from hell that is a original version from 78 and at least this version had some cute and heartwarming moments for entire families that will give them a great time while watching it unlike the first version that give me memories that will haunt me for the rest of life bu at least this version wont do such a thing to a kids.Story was cute here and it had many throwbacks to a older films and its memes like Hello there and shirtless Ben Swolo.In end this film will be a good fun for entire families and kids,12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
52136602,18 November 2020,"A fun story set on life day after the sequel trilogy is finished. It has more character growth for Rey in this 40 minute Lego special, than the whole trilogy has combined.

It's a LEGO animation!!) then you'll have a great time. Very similar to other Lego Star Wars animated series, with goofy humor and silliness (and lots of fun). This also gives us a peak at Post-Rise of Skywalker Star Wars, which is a great bonus as well.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
107923571,5 December 2020,It has many meta jokes and references that if you catch them it puts a smile on your face. It's also nice to see some content post rise of Skywalker. Rose has more lines and screen time than in that movie. Rey has more character development than in the whole trilogy. But that's just me appealing to the sequel haters. It also includes a lot of all the aspects of Star Wars from all generations and it's nice to see it all brought together.,12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special

715971,23 November 2020,"I've never seen the original holiday special, but the legends of ""Life Day"" have made their way to my consciousness somehow. In a similar, gently mocking, way as their other output, the Lego Star Wars team create a new story that is not entirely successful, but has some good moments.Rey (Helen Sadler) is disappointed with her inability to successful teach Finn (Omar Miller) the ways of the Force. Learning about a secret ""key"" she and BB8 head off to search for it leaving behind the rest of their friends to celebrate life day on board the Falcon. The key allows Rey to travel through time, and she begins to interact with other Star Wars characters at key points in their lives, until a meeting with the Emperor (Trevor Devall) who demands a still loyal Vader (Matt Sloan) retrieves the key for him.So, produced by Disney, this was never going to scathing demolition of any aspects of the Star Wars Universe. Instead it takes some affectionate shots at a few of the more comical aspects of the series - Kylo Ren not wearing a shirt and how Star Killer Base is essentially Death Star 3. I struggled a bit with the pratfalls of the opening sections, but it did get more amusing as it got further along. Vocally though, it's not great. Only Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels and Kelly Marie Tran return to voice their characters, most of the rest of the vocal impressions I'd classify as just indistinct, i.e. Omar Miller doesn't sound like John Boyega and Jake Green doesn't sound like Oscar Isaac. However, given that we hear so much of it, Helen Salder's overly nasal Rey is quite a bit too far and doesn't sound very flattering to Daisy Ridley.Visually, it's not quite up to the standards of rendering that you see in say ""The Lego Movie"", presumably as they didn't quite have the budget but there are some interesting scenes - particularly a large-scale battle that takes place towards the end.It's a decent family friendly Star Wars comedy, but not quite clever enough to live long in the memory.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
127650304,23 January 2021,"Words can not say enough to say this was only made to put the new characters (one precisely) ahead of all of Star Wars first- storylines and good plots mean nothing anymore, only making Sequel characters the best ever.

71521775,2 January 2021,"The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special just serves to remind you of how much potential the characters and story of The Force Awakens had, and how much the subsequent two films dropped the ball. The whole thing is based on a premise introduced in the first film and abandoned afterward - Finn being a potential Jedi. Rey's frustrations at being unable to train him and need to find out what she's doing wrong set her off on a time-traveling journey that takes her from The Phantom Menace to The Mandalorian. The result is an affectionate parody of all eras of Star Wars that still has genuine heart - it feels like Rankin-Bass were hired to do one of Family Guy's Star Wars episodes. We have two Darth Vaders from different timelines fighting each other, Palpatine acting like everyone's cranky boss, two different Han Solos looking to shoot Greedo first, and even an appearance by Chewie's family from the original Star Wars Holiday Special. The writers even skewer fan pet peeves ranging from the Trade Federation to Kylo Ren's shirtlessness. And Rose Tico gets redeemed - she even gets to sing a hilarious karaoke duet with Finn! This is pure entertainment no fan of Star Wars should pass by. Makes you wish the Lego crew had been put in charge of the entire sequel trilogy.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
49400835,7 February 2021,"Perfectly fine for what it is.'The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special' is OK, not necessarily good or bad. A couple of the actors carry over from the 'Star Wars' franchise itself, though the vast majority of main stars from the aforementioned do not. The plot is split three ways in terms of how I enjoyed them.The best stuff, for me, is the bits with Palpatine and Darth Vader, Trevor Devall undoubtedly gives the best voice performance as the former. The parts with Rey, who is voiced unconvincingly and borderline irritatingly by Helen Sadler, is watchable. Lastly, the stuff with Finn &amp; Co. is uninteresting filler.On Sadler's story in this, I did enjoy seeing them go back through the films from the main franchise - though I would've liked it more if they did it in a more clever and amusing way, à la 'The Lion King 1½' with the Pride Rock scene.At just 44mins and with the nessacary - if not a great deal of - festive vibe, it's practically impossible to dislike this... at least for me. It's also light years ahead of its 1978 predecessor, not that that's difficult mind.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
24085266,17 January 2021,"The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special is Disney's answer to 1978's 'classic disaster' that was the original Holiday Special. This one's amusing, unlike the original one *shivers*: because THIS ones got a story and doesn't focus on Wookiees growling at each other for FAR too long. This one is NOT a complete mess, and tries to address all the Star Wars memes that have spawned since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012.This special is cute, harmless and self-aware that will give longtime Star Wars fans a chuckle or two: but it's just time-killing Christmas entertainment in the end. That's not a bad thing: it just doesn't help the special's longevity AFTER the fact that it's made for Holidays instead of being an interesting piece of work itself.Disney+ has got some hefty Star Wars stuff in the pipeline, and this special, along with The Mandalorian, is just the beginning for their plans on where to take that galaxy far, far away.Cute entertainment: so inoffensive it might disappoint with its lack of 'bite'.",12885438,The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special
